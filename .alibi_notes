# Alibi System Notes

This repository has been converted from Letter+ (newsletter system) to Alibi (incident management).

## Active System: Alibi

The main product is now in the `alibi/` package:
- Core engine: alibi/alibi_engine.py
- Validation: alibi/validator.py
- Tests: tests/test_alibi_engine_validation.py

## Old Newsletter Files

The following files are from the old Letter+ system and are NOT used by Alibi:
- newsletter_*.py
- app.py (old newsletter UI)
- *_newsletter_*.py
- data/newsletters_*.json
- data/newsletter_*.json
- data/published_newsletters.json
- data/generation_history.json

These files remain in the repo for reference but do not affect Alibi functionality.

## Running Alibi

```bash
# Demo
PYTHONPATH=. python alibi/demo.py

# Tests
pytest tests/test_alibi_engine_validation.py -v

# Simple example
PYTHONPATH=. python alibi/example.py
```

## Key Safety Rules

1. No accusatory language (enforced)
2. Low confidence → monitor only (enforced)
3. High severity/watchlist → human approval required (enforced)
4. Actions must reference evidence (enforced)

See alibi/README.md for full documentation.
