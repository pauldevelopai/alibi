# Rule-Based Event Detection Configuration
#
# Thresholds for time-based incident triggers.
# Adjust these based on your security requirements.

# Loitering detection
loitering:

  threshold_seconds: 30.0
  
  # Zones where loitering is monitored
  monitored_zones:
    - entrance

  # Classes to monitor for loitering
  classes:
    - person

# Object left unattended
unattended_object:
  # Minimum time stationary before triggering (seconds)
  threshold_seconds: 60.0
  
  # Classes considered "objects" (not people)

  # Zones where this rule applies
  monitored_zones:
    - entrance

  # Set to 0 for immediate alert
  min_duration_seconds: 5.0
  
  # Zone types considered restricted
  restricted_types:
    - restricted
    - private
  
  # Classes that trigger alerts in restricted zones
  alert_classes:

# Global settings
global:
  # Minimum track confirmation hits before rules apply
