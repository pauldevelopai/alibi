        "The media has always been at the centre of the AI explosion and while last year it looked like it was taking serious hits, in 2025 it showed that there was a willingness to embrace AI and double down on quality journalism that holds the powerful to account. Here are the lessons learnt from the workDevelop AIhas done this year around the world.",
        "I was in Copenhagen last week, which is a lovely theme park type of city. I was speaking at IMS’sCopenhagen Conference on Information Integrityon a panel about AI and the future of media. One of my fellow panellists was the Danish Tech Ambassador, Anne Marie Engtoft Meldgaard. She was the first in the world to hold this kind of position and she had just come from the US where everyone she spoke to was obsessed with AIG (the development of a super intelligence that will replace us all). In contrast, the tone and incredible calibre of speakers at the conference (which took place at UN City) made me feel like the EU is focused on the moral and humane use of tech in the world and how we can harness it for good.",

        "For the longest time I have told people, “I’m not a coder. I use ChatGPT.” But that has begun to change. I still use ChatGPT for help, but I am getting a tighter grip every day on how software is built and what it is capable of.",
        "I remember when my PC began to search the actual words inside my Word documents rather than just the titles of my files… it was a complete game changer. It felt like this evolution in search would solve all of my life’s problems. But now, decades later, I just feel like I am drowning in Zoom call recordings and endless WhatsApp group images. The most exciting part of the AI revolution, for me, is that we will finally have order and insights from all this data we have been collecting."
