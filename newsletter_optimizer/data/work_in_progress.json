    "opening_hook": "The defense I have heard for the proliferation of Elon Musk and his X empire is that he is pushing freedom of expression to its limits and we need people like that to test what is possible, but at this point that attitude is warped and naïve. Musk has been transparent about the intent of his “everything app” and it is not to improve or maintain our democracies. This is an app that is actively spreading disinformation and encouraging its users to be as cruel as possible to each other. I have seen the benefits in the world to allowing people to speak their minds, but the power of speech has now been amplified to such an extent that we are not only going to have to accept regulation, but demand it.",
