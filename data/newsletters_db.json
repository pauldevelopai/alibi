          "content": "# AI 2026: How Tech Hubs Are Reshaping the Newsroom\n\n*Silicon Valley is racing into 2026 with new AI models, and newsrooms are still playing catch-up.*\n\nI spent the week buried in press releases from Apple and OpenAI, and it feels like déjà vu. Every year it’s a fresh round of promises, but this year the stakes are different. If you’re running a newsroom in 2026, you’re not just chasing shiny tools. You’re trying to survive their impact.\n\n**📋 This Week in AI: Tech Hubs and Tidal Waves**\n\nApple’s new AI integration for news apps is everywhere right now. On paper, it’s called Apple News Intelligence. It scrapes, summarizes, and “personalizes” the news feed on every iPhone and iPad. The big feature? Contextual recommendations based on your reading history and location. But when I tried it, it felt like an old trick in a new interface. Apple is still pulling from the same pool of wire stories and publisher feeds—just now with a layer of AI-filtered headlines. \n\nBehind the curtain, it’s more about keeping users inside the Apple ecosystem than real innovation. The talk is about “serving the right story at the right time.” The reality: more algorithmic curation, less editorial control for actual journalists. [PLACEHOLDER: need source on newsroom feedback to Apple News Intelligence.]\n\nOpenAI’s partnership with Reuters is the other headline. Reuters will license its archive and live news wire to OpenAI, feeding ChatGPT and other models with real-time updates and (presumably) better training data. Who wins? OpenAI, obviously. They get a global news pipeline for their bots. Reuters gets a big cheque and maybe a foot in the door for new distribution. But smaller publishers lose out. If you’re not Reuters, you’re now even less visible on the platforms that matter.\n\nI spoke to a tech editor at a mid-sized European publisher this week. She’s worried her newsroom will slide further down the food chain—more invisible, less essential. OpenAI isn’t partnering with her, and there’s no seat at the table for independent voices. It’s the same story: the big get bigger, the rest scramble for scraps.\n\nGoogle quietly rolled out a major update to Gemini. Western newsrooms barely blinked. The new feature? Automated “news briefs” that pull from local outlets and generate summaries for Google Discover and Assistant. I tested it with a few UK and US local news stories. The AI versions are bland, accurate, but soulless. They strip out any hint of personality. That’s the point: scale up news, strip out friction, and keep users on Google’s pages. There’s almost no credit given to the original outlets. I haven’t seen a single publisher outside the big US brands happy about this.\n\n**🏠 What’s Happening at Develop AI**\n\nI’m launching a new series: AI Toolkits for Small Newsrooms. The first batch is aimed at Western partners—think local publishers in the UK, small dailies in France, and indie newsrooms in Canada. The goal is simple: show what you can actually use, not what Silicon Valley is hyping this week. There’s a gap opening up between what’s being sold and what’s genuinely useful for real newsrooms. I want to close that gap.\n\nOver the past month, I’ve been consulting with a UK-based publisher testing automated local news feeds. They’re using a mix of ChatGPT, NewsWhip, and their own CMS triggers. The results: traffic is up, but engagement is flat. Automated weather and traffic updates are easy wins. But when they tried more complex local council coverage, the AI missed context and nuance every time. Their editors are now treating AI as a drafting tool—never the final word. It’s saving time, but not replacing anyone yet.\n\nNext week, I’ll be on a panel at MIT Media Lab: “AI and the Newsroom: Lessons from Silicon Valley.” The other speakers are all from US startups or big tech. I’ll be the only one with hands-on experience in smaller, less-resourced newsrooms. My take? We need to stop treating every tool as if it works out of the box. Context, workflow, and actual newsroom needs matter more than whatever Google demoed last week.\n\n**👋 See you next week.**\n\nThe pace of Western AI releases is relentless. Every week it’s another “breakthrough” from Apple, OpenAI, or Google. Most of it is incremental. Some of it’s useful. None of it is slowing down.\n\nIf you want more real-world breakdowns (and fewer buzzwords), subscribe for the next issue. I’ll keep tracking Silicon Valley’s latest move, so you don’t have to.\n\nAll the best,\n\nPaul\n\nStay alert: the Western tech giants are moving fast, and if you’re working in media, you need to keep up—or risk being left behind.",

          "content": "# Why AI in 2026 is Less Impressive Than You Think\n\n*Everyone says AI in 2026 is unstoppable. My experience this week says otherwise.*\n\nI spent most of last week toggling between Google’s latest Gemini for Workspace and OpenAI’s new “Omni-Assist” layer in ChatGPT Pro. The marketing is everywhere—YouTube pre-rolls, LinkedIn posts, those endless Substack threads telling you to “embrace the future.” But after a week of actual use, I’m left thinking: This is it?\n\nI’m not saying nothing has changed. But for journalists and media people, the 2026 upgrade cycle feels like a familiar sales pitch in a different wrapper. Let me break down what’s real, what’s recycled, and what actually helps.\n\n---\n\n**🛠️ Tools & Tips: What Actually Works in 2026**\n\n1. **Google Gemini for Workspace**\n\nHere’s what they promise: fully integrated research, summarisation, and auto-drafting in Docs, Sheets, and even Gmail. Supposedly, you feed Gemini your notes, interview transcripts, and it spits out “polished, accurate, bias-free articles.”\n\nHere’s what actually happens: I threw a week’s worth of interview notes (real, messy, a mix of WhatsApp voice notes and Google Meet transcriptions) into Gemini inside Docs. The first summary missed the main quote from an editor at *Mail & Guardian* entirely. The draft it generated for a story on load-shedding relied on two-year-old stats from a World Bank PDF I’d uploaded as “background.” It hallucinated an interview with Eskom that I never did.\n\nI tried the same workflow with OpenAI’s new “Omni-Assist” plugin in ChatGPT Pro. It’s meant to “contextualise” your news gathering by tying together web data, old PDFs, and live chats. But the first result was a Frankenstein of phrases from my own reporting, mixed with whole sentences lifted from *Reuters* coverage. I ran the output through Copyleaks and got 48% flagged as duplicate content.\n\n> **AI lesson:** The only real productivity gain is in grunt work. Gemini is decent at cleaning up your calendar, finding double-booked interviews, and sorting sources by date. But for reporting, context, and quotes—still manual. If you’re looking for a workflow hack, use Gemini to sift through your messy calendar invites and emails, but do not trust it with the actual story.\n\n2. **The Workflow That’s Actually Useful**\n\nI’m still using *Otter.ai* (yes, still around) for transcribing WhatsApp voice notes, especially for interviews in noisy environments. Then I drop the transcripts into [NEED: new, reliable summarisation tool]—not Gemini, not OpenAI—and do a side-by-side check with my own notes. It’s slower, but at least I’m not publishing AI-invented sources.\n\n> **If you’re a journalist:** Use the AI to clean and sort your data. Don’t let it near your final copy. Never trust an “auto-summary” to catch nuance or intent.\n\n---\n\n**🔮 Future / Predictions: Same Old Biases, Same Old Problems**\n\nI’ve read half a dozen “What’s Next For AI in Media?” think pieces this month. They all say the same thing: “This time it’s different.” It isn’t.\n\n- **Quality is still unreliable.** I spoke to [NEED: editor at Daily Maverick] who said their experiment with Gemini-generated newsletters lasted two weeks. Too many hallucinations, not enough unique voice. Their audience noticed the change and engagement dropped.\n\n- **Language and local context? Still bad.** Google and OpenAI both claim “major improvements” in African language support, but when I tested Gemini with Setswana and Yoruba, the results were embarrassing. Names misspelled, context lost, and quotes mangled. [NEED: link to failed Setswana summary]\n\n- **Western focus dominates.** The big feature drops—the “AI Newsroom Dashboard” from Microsoft, the new “Fact-Check” plugin for ChatGPT, even Google’s local news recommendations—are all piloted in the US, UK, or Germany. I have yet to see a single African newsroom get early access without a partner grant from DW Akademie or IMS footing the bill.\n\n- **2027 prediction:** Unless one of these giants radically opens up their models or actually builds with journalists outside New York and London, we’re in for another year of incremental upgrades. Slightly better summaries. Maybe a new “diversity” sticker. But nothing that changes the day-to-day grind for real reporters.\n\n---\n\n**2026’s AI: The Same Faces in Different Hoodies**\n\nThe parade hasn’t changed—OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta. Every “new” feature is mostly a remix: Gemini’s “Live Research” is just a rebranded Google Alerts with chat. ChatGPT’s “Omni-Assist” feels like a souped-up Chrome extension from 2022. And every major AI launch still features the same row of white men in hoodies talking about “democratising information.”\n\nThe diversity push? I see more slides about “inclusion” at conferences, but I don’t see more African or Latin American newsrooms in the pilots. Most teams I talk to in Johannesburg or Nairobi are still running open-source models on borrowed GPUs or using Hugging Face endpoints because the big boys won’t unlock their APIs without a credit card and a Delaware registration.\n\n> **If you want to dodge the hype:** Ignore the “breakthrough” launches. Look for open-source stuff on Hugging Face, or try [NEED: specific African LLM] if you want local context.

          "content": "# AI 2026: How Silicon Valley's New Bets Will Shape Your Newsroom\n\n*Silicon Valley is moving fast on AI in 2026, but newsrooms are already playing catch up.*\n\nThis week has been a blur of launches and announcements, most of them coming from the big end of the tech pool. I’ve spent the last few days trawling through Apple keynotes, OpenAI press releases, and the usual flood of Google blog posts. The story, as always, isn’t just about the shiny new tools. It’s about what gets left behind, and who’s actually going to use any of this.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 This Week’s AI News Roundup\n\n### 1. Apple’s M4 Chip and On-Device AI\n\nApple finally rolled out the M4 chip, and the press is calling it the “AI MacBook.” The real story is that Apple’s moving away from cloud-heavy LLMs and pushing everything onto the device itself. That means your news app (or your CMS, if you’re fancy) could soon be running its own mini AI model, without sending data anywhere.\n\nThe pitch: privacy, speed, and “personalised content.” The reality: most publishers are nowhere near ready for this. I spoke to a tech lead at [NEED: name of UK regional publisher] who said they’re still using a WordPress plugin from 2017 to manage their newsletters. But Apple’s demo of on-device summarisation and speech-to-text is impressive. If you’re running editorial workflows on a MacBook, you’ll see these features creep in by default.\n\n> **AI lesson:**  \n> If you’re producing sensitive content, on-device AI could help you keep your user data away from OpenAI or Google. But you’ll also need to rethink how you train and update your models—because you can’t just ship everything to the cloud and hope for the best.\n\n### 2. OpenAI + Reuters: News Summaries, Again\n\nOpenAI announced a partnership with Reuters to deliver “AI-powered news summaries.” If this sounds familiar, it’s because it is. We’ve seen similar deals with Associated Press, Axel Springer, and a few others. What’s actually new is the integration: Reuters is giving OpenAI a direct newsfeed to train and update their models, not just a one-off archive dump.\n\nI got a look at the beta via a friend at Reuters. The summaries are fast, but they’re bland. No context, no local flavour, just the facts. That’s fine for a newswire, but not if you want your reporting to stand out. The interesting bit? Reuters gets a window into how OpenAI is using their content, at least in theory. Most African publishers are still locked out of these deals, and there are zero transparency guarantees on how this data will be used downstream.\n\n> **AI lesson:**  \n> If you’re a newsroom thinking about licensing deals or model training, ask for audit rights. See how your content is being used—don’t just take the money and walk away.\n\n### 3. Google Gemini 2.0: Search and Workspace Get Smarter, Publishers Get Sidelined\n\nGoogle’s new Gemini 2.0 is now baked into Search and Workspace. If you’re using Docs, Gmail, or even Sheets, you’ve probably seen the “Help me write” button get a lot more persistent. The bigger impact is in Search—AI overviews are now the first thing users see, pushing publisher links even further down the page.\n\nI ran a test this week with a group of journalism students at Wits University. We searched for basic news topics—load shedding updates, local council elections, the usual. The Gemini-powered answers were fast and accurate, but the source links were hidden behind a “Show more” button. Most students never clicked through. If you’re a publisher, expect your traffic to drop even further.\n\n> **AI lesson:**  \n> Don’t build your business on Google referrals. Start moving your content onto channels you control—newsletters, WhatsApp, SMS, anything that isn’t filtered by an algorithm in Mountain View.\n\n### 4. The Deeper Issue: Who Gets Left Out?\n\nAll these announcements have a common thread: big tech companies are consolidating power, but the tools are getting more closed off. Apple’s on-device AI is only for people who can afford the latest hardware. OpenAI’s partnerships are with the biggest wire services. Google’s Gemini is tuned for the US and Europe first, with African and Asian languages still a distant afterthought.\n\nI spoke to [NEED: name of Tanzanian editor] about how their newsroom is using AI. They’re still relying on WhatsApp groups and manual fact-checking, because none of these new tools support Swahili properly. Even the best text-to-speech models butcher local names and phrases. The risk is that the next wave of AI will be even more exclusionary than the last.\n\n> **AI lesson:**  \n> If you’re in Africa or the Global South, don’t wait for Silicon Valley to build the tools you need. Start experimenting with open-source models, or partner with local developers. The gap is only going to widen if you don’t build your own solutions.\n\n### 5. Practical Takeaways for Newsrooms\n\n1. **Audit your tech stack.** If you’re still relying on Google or Facebook for traffic, start diversifying now.\n2. **Test on-device AI.** Try the new M4 MacBooks or iPads—see what you can actually do with local models.\n3. **Push for transparency.** If you’re licensing content, demand insight into how your work is being used.\n4. **Experiment with open models.** Don’t wait for the big players to localise—try tools like Hugging Face, Cohere, or open-source LLMs.\n5. **Keep your audience close.** Newsletters, WhatsApp, SMS—all still work, and you own the relationship.\n\n> **Key takeaway:**  \n> The future of AI in newsrooms won’t be decided in Cupertino or San Francisco. It’ll be shaped by whoever actually builds and adapts these tools to fit real workflows—and that can (and should) be you.\n\n---\n\n## 🏠 What’s Happening at Develop AI\n\nI was part of a panel at Newsrewired in London this week. The session was on AI editorial workflows. The most interesting thing: everyone’s talking about automation, but only a handful of newsrooms are doing it beyond headline generation. Shout out to The Bureau of Investigative Journalism—their experiments with AI-powered FOIA request tracking are worth watching. (More on that soon.)\n\nOur latest podcast episode on AI-generated news voice-overs was picked up by Nieman Lab. If you missed it, it’s here. We break down what works (and what doesn’t) when you use ElevenLabs, PlayHT and Google’s voice tools in real reporting.\n\nWe’ve also published a new practical guide: “How to Actually Test AI Content Detection Tools in 2026.” Spoiler: most of them still don’t work. You can download the resource here.\n\n---\n\n## 👋 See You Next Week\n\nThanks for reading and supporting Develop AI. Next week: a deep dive into how small newsrooms are using AI chatbots for community engagement (with real numbers and names). If you’ve tried something that works—or doesn’t—let me know. Email me or DM on LinkedIn.\n\nAll the best,  \nPaul",

          "content": "# AI 2026: How to Actually Use What Silicon Valley Is Building\n\n*The West is already moving on to the next AI obsession. Everyone else is still cleaning up the mess.*\n\nI spent two days last month in a Johannesburg newsroom staring at the same “AI-powered news dashboard” demo that the New York Times used in 2024. Two years later, the US has moved on to AGI panic and “sentient editorial assistants.” Meanwhile, we’re still trying to get the bylines right on AI rewrites of council minutes. This is what Silicon Valley does: launch, abandon, repeat.\n\nBut plenty of people aren’t waiting for the next miracle. They’re making these half-finished tools work—sometimes in ways OpenAI never imagined. That’s what actually matters in 2026.\n\n---\n\n**1. The Core Issue: Silicon Valley Moves On, The Rest of Us Patch the Holes**\n\nSilicon Valley cycles through AI trends like TikTok dances. Last year it was AI video tools. Now it’s “autonomous agents” and whatever OpenAI is teasing next. But every time a new model drops, the hype cycle restarts and the old problems get swept under the rug.\n\nNewsrooms outside the US, especially those in Africa and Southeast Asia, are often left with the “legacy” versions and little technical support. The result? You get a Frankenstein’s monster of tools, plugins, and Google Sheets, all duct-taped together to meet deadlines.\n\nWhen I was in Accra, the Daily Graphic’s digital team showed me their Gemini-powered news aggregator. It scrapes local WhatsApp groups and pushes summaries to their Telegram channel. Is it pretty? No. Is it effective? Yes. They’re not waiting for Google to localize Project Mercury—they’re hacking it together themselves.\n\n---\n\n**2. Deep Analysis: The Real Work is Unsexy**\n\nThe big AI headlines are always about “disruption.” But the real work is a lot less glamorous. It’s about using OpenAI’s models to automate the boring stuff—rewriting press releases, translating into local languages, prepping data for the 6am newsletter.\n\nNobody at the Guardian is sending prompts to ChatGPT for the front page. But they are using AI to check facts, flag potential legal issues, and speed up subbing. I’ve seen the same at The Namibian and at El Tiempo in Colombia. These aren’t shiny “generative” projects; they’re workflow hacks.\n\nThe problem is, most of these tools are built for English, and they’re trained on US data. So you end up spending half your time fixing translation errors or tweaking summary prompts so they don’t hallucinate Zimbabwean ministers. The gap between what’s promised and what actually gets used is massive.\n\n---\n\n**3. Real Examples: Newsrooms Making It Work**\n\n- **NYT**: Still using a custom version of ChatGPT for first drafts, but with a human editor rewriting everything for voice and accuracy. The AI is good at bullet points, bad at context. [NEED: name of NYT digital editor]\n- **Der Spiegel**: Created an in-house “mini-LLM” trained on Spiegel archives. Used mainly for background research and to surface old reporting. It’s slow, but the journalists trust it more than GPT-4.\n- **The Continent (South Africa)**: Uses WhatsApp bots built on open-source LLMs to gather reader tips and auto-tag stories for follow-up. I helped them build the first version in Python, but they’ve since migrated to a no-code platform.\n- **Daily Graphic (Ghana)**: Their Gemini hack mentioned above—no support from Google, but it works for getting rural stories surfaced in Accra.\n\n> **AI lesson:** Stop waiting for the “perfect” tool. Use what’s available, patch the gaps, and build your own glue. The best AI projects in news are never off-the-shelf.\n\n---\n\n**4. The Africa/Global South Angle: More Risk, More Ingenuity**\n\nThe gap between flashy demos and working software is wider in the Global South. Here, “AI integration” usually means a WhatsApp bot and three Google Forms. But that means more room for improvisation.\n\nI’ve seen newsrooms in Lagos using open weights from Meta’s Llama 3, fine-tuned on Nigerian English. In Nairobi, journalists are stringing together free APIs to build their own headline generators because the mainstream ones can’t handle local names.\n\nThe dark side is dependency. When Google or Meta quietly kill a product, there’s no backup. I’ve watched whole news projects collapse because an “AI-powered” WhatsApp number went offline after a Meta update.\n\n---\n\n**5. Practical Takeaway: Make AI Your Servant, Not Your Master**\n\nAI is the new CMS: messy, undercooked, but you’re stuck with it. Stop waiting for the next release from San Francisco. Build on what’s here. Document your hacks. Share with other newsrooms.\n\n> **What you can do:**\n> 1. Pick one AI tool—Gemini, ChatGPT, Llama, whatever—and use it for a single workflow.\n> 2. Keep a log of what breaks and how you fix it.\n> 3. Share your fixes. I’ll publish the best ones in this newsletter.\n\nThe future isn’t going to be delivered from the cloud. You’re building it every day.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 This Week in AI\n\n- OpenAI’s new model is rolling out quietly to select US newsrooms. Still zero transparency on what went into the training data. [NEED: specific newsroom name]\n- Google just launched Project Mercury in the UK. It’s a hyperlocal news aggregator powered by Gemini, but from what I’ve seen, there are no actual journalists involved—just auto-summaries.\n- Meta’s AI video tool is now standard for US publishers. European ones are ignoring it—no sign of adoption at Le Monde or Die Zeit.\n\n---\n\n## 🎙️ Podcast Episode: How AI 2026 Changes Newsroom Workflows\n\nI spoke to editors at the NYT and Der Spiegel about what AI tools are actually in use, not just the ones from press releases. The biggest bottleneck? Automation helps with summaries, but editorial judgment still needs a human. Layoffs are up, AI-powered content is everywhere, and nobody agrees on what counts as “original reporting” anymore.\n\nListen to the episode here: [LINK]\n\n---\n\n## 📣 Subscribe & Stay Ahead\n\nWant practical newsroom AI tools?

          "content": "# Here is how to use AI on your past newsletter stats and create a fresh one that hits every day\n\n*I rebuilt my own newsletter archive using AI tools—and you can too. Here’s a step-by-step guide.*\n\nI spent last week rebuilding the entire Develop AI newsletter archive. Not by hand. Not with another endless spreadsheet. I did it with a couple of AI prompts, a few copy-pastes, and a bit of time staring at Google Colab. The result? I can now remix old issues, find which topics hit hardest, and generate fresh editions that actually land every single day.\n\nThis is a huge step up from the usual “publish and forget” cycle. Most newsletters, especially here in Africa, get sent out, maybe shared once, then vanish into the void. I wanted to see if AI could change that. Not just for me, but for any journalist, editor, or small newsroom that wants to squeeze more value out of what they’ve already made.\n\n**Why this matters now**\n\nThe myth: you need to be a coder, have a data team, or subscribe to some Silicon Valley platform to do any of this. Not true. You need ChatGPT, Claude, or Google Colab (all tools I’ve written about and used in the last few months). That’s it.\n\nThe smarter newsrooms in the US and Europe have been running these kinds of “content surfacing” workflows for years. But they’re usually built on expensive systems, or hidden behind the paywall of whatever Substack is rolling out next. Meanwhile, small teams in Lagos or Nairobi are sitting on years of untapped stories, newsletters, and podcasts that could be repackaged, translated, or just made visible again. It’s not about automation for its own sake. It’s about reach.\n\n**How I did it (and how you can too)**\n\nHere’s the workflow I landed on:\n\n1. **Export your newsletter archive.**  \n   For Substack, just go to “Settings” and hit “Export.” For Mailchimp, same story. You want a CSV or spreadsheet with all your past issues, dates, and subject lines.\n\n2. **Paste into ChatGPT or Claude.**  \n   I used ChatGPT-4o for this. Prompt: “Summarise the top themes, most opened issues, and which topics had the highest click rates.” It spat out a rough ranking and a list of “most engaging” stories. It even grouped similar topics (AI video, podcasting, coding tips).\n\n3. **Feed it into Google Colab.**  \n   This is where it gets more interesting. I asked ChatGPT to generate Python code that would pull in my spreadsheet, analyse open rates, and cluster topics by popularity. I’m not a developer, but this step took less than 30 minutes. You copy, paste, run.  \n   _(If you get stuck, message me. I’ll share the exact code I used.)_\n\n4. **Generate new newsletter drafts.**  \n   The final step: prompt ChatGPT to “write a new 500-word newsletter based on the three top-performing topics from the last six months.” I got three drafts, each with a different angle, all based on what had already resonated.\n\n> **AI lesson:** You don’t need a custom CMS or six months of training. With free tools and a couple of prompts, you can take your newsletter archive and turn it into a content engine that runs itself.\n\n**What’s deeper here?**\n\nThere’s a strange shame in reusing your own stories. But with AI, the lines blur between “archive” and “fresh.” I’ve noticed (and this is backed up by what I’ve seen at DW Akademie trainings in Tanzania and South Africa) that audiences outside of tech hubs often miss the first wave of content. Resurfacing isn’t lazy—it’s necessary. It gives your work a second life.\n\nThe other big point: you see what actually works. Not what you think works. When I ran my own stats through Claude, it showed that my detailed coding guides got triple the engagement of any generic “AI news” post. I would never have guessed that. This kind of analysis is immediate, and it’s changing how I plan every issue.\n\n**Real examples from the field**\n\n- At the Nation Media Group in Kenya, they’re starting to use these methods to repackage old health stories for their WhatsApp audience. The results: higher engagement, and more shares from people who missed the original newsletter.\n- A small newsroom in Zimbabwe (shoutout to CITE) is using ChatGPT to pull stories from their archive and create daily radio scripts, in English and Ndebele. This is huge for reaching people who prefer audio.\n- At DW Akademie workshops, we coached reporters to use Claude to summarise and translate old investigative pieces—saving weeks of manual effort.\n\n**Africa/Global South angle**\n\nLet’s be clear: most African newsrooms don’t have a decade of digital archives, or a team of analysts mining Mailchimp data. But this is precisely why these AI workflows matter here. If you have even a few dozen newsletters, you can now reach new audiences, experiment with language, or build daily WhatsApp digests—all without spending on extra staff or software.\n\nThere’s no need to wait for Silicon Valley to “unlock” this for you. The tools are already here, and they work just as well in Nairobi as in New York.\n\n**Your practical takeaway**\n\nExport your archive. Paste it into ChatGPT or Claude. Ask: “What are my top stories, and how should I remix them?” Build a new issue in twenty minutes. If you want my code or templates, get in touch. This is the future for small teams—and it’s not complicated.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 This Week in AI News\n\n- Kenya’s Nation Media Group is trialling an AI-powered WhatsApp assistant for daily news summaries. Early tests are promising, especially for younger audiences.\n- Meta has rolled out a new version of its Llama model. African languages are still mostly absent. The wait for meaningful Swahili or Yoruba support continues.\n- DW Akademie published a new report showing small newsrooms using ChatGPT to automate basic reporting tasks. Some love it, some are frustrated by bland outputs and hallucinations.\n\n---\n\n## 🏠 What’s Happening at Develop AI\n\n- Our next free online workshop: “How to use ChatGPT to code your own newsroom tools.” Sign up link coming next week.\n- We’re expanding the Develop AI WhatsApp community. Invites are open for journalists in Southern and East Africa—reply to this newsletter if you want in.\n\nAll the best,\n\nPaul",

          "content": "# Here is how to use AI on your past newsletter stats and create a fresh one that hits every day\n\n*I rebuilt my own newsletter archive using AI tools—and you can too. Here’s a step-by-step guide.*\n\nI spent last week rebuilding the entire Develop AI newsletter archive. Not by hand. Not with another endless spreadsheet. I did it with a couple of AI prompts, a few copy-pastes, and a bit of time staring at Google Colab. The result? I can now remix old issues, find which topics hit hardest, and generate fresh editions that actually land every single day.\n\nThis is a huge step up from the usual “publish and forget” cycle. Most newsletters, especially here in Africa, get sent out, maybe shared once, then vanish into the void. I wanted to see if AI could change that. Not just for me, but for any journalist, editor, or small newsroom that wants to squeeze more value out of what they’ve already made.\n\n**Why this matters now**\n\nThe myth: you need to be a coder, have a data team, or subscribe to some Silicon Valley platform to do any of this. Not true. You need ChatGPT, Claude, or Google Colab (all tools I’ve written about and used in the last few months). That’s it.\n\nThe smarter newsrooms in the US and Europe have been running these kinds of “content surfacing” workflows for years. But they’re usually built on expensive systems, or hidden behind the paywall of whatever Substack is rolling out next. Meanwhile, small teams in Lagos or Nairobi are sitting on years of untapped stories, newsletters, and podcasts that could be repackaged, translated, or just made visible again. It’s not about automation for its own sake. It’s about reach.\n\n**How I did it (and how you can too)**\n\nHere’s the workflow I landed on:\n\n1. **Export your newsletter archive.**  \n   For Substack, just go to “Settings” and hit “Export.” For Mailchimp, same story. You want a CSV or spreadsheet with all your past issues, dates, and subject lines.\n\n2. **Paste into ChatGPT or Claude.**  \n   I used ChatGPT-4o for this. Prompt: “Summarise the top themes, most opened issues, and which topics had the highest click rates.” It spat out a rough ranking and a list of “most engaging” stories. It even grouped similar topics (AI video, podcasting, coding tips).\n\n3. **Feed it into Google Colab.**  \n   This is where it gets more interesting. I asked ChatGPT to generate Python code that would pull in my spreadsheet, analyse open rates, and cluster topics by popularity. I’m not a developer, but this step took less than 30 minutes. You copy, paste, run.  \n   _(If you get stuck, message me. I’ll share the exact code I used.)_\n\n4. **Generate new newsletter drafts.**  \n   The final step: prompt ChatGPT to “write a new 500-word newsletter based on the three top-performing topics from the last six months.” I got three drafts, each with a different angle, all based on what had already resonated.\n\n> **AI lesson:** You don’t need a custom CMS or six months of training. With free tools and a couple of prompts, you can take your newsletter archive and turn it into a content engine that runs itself.\n\n**What’s deeper here?**\n\nThere’s a strange shame in reusing your own stories. But with AI, the lines blur between “archive” and “fresh.” I’ve noticed (and this is backed up by what I’ve seen at DW Akademie trainings in Tanzania and South Africa) that audiences outside of tech hubs often miss the first wave of content. Resurfacing isn’t lazy—it’s necessary. It gives your work a second life.\n\nThe other big point: you see what actually works. Not what you think works. When I ran my own stats through Claude, it showed that my detailed coding guides got triple the engagement of any generic “AI news” post. I would never have guessed that. This kind of analysis is immediate, and it’s changing how I plan every issue.\n\n**Real examples from the field**\n\n- At the Nation Media Group in Kenya, they’re starting to use these methods to repackage old health stories for their WhatsApp audience. The results: higher engagement, and more shares from people who missed the original newsletter.\n- A small newsroom in Zimbabwe (shoutout to CITE) is using ChatGPT to pull stories from their archive and create daily radio scripts, in English and Ndebele. This is huge for reaching people who prefer audio.\n- At DW Akademie workshops, we coached reporters to use Claude to summarise and translate old investigative pieces—saving weeks of manual effort.\n\n**Africa/Global South angle**\n\nLet’s be clear: most African newsrooms don’t have a decade of digital archives, or a team of analysts mining Mailchimp data. But this is precisely why these AI workflows matter here. If you have even a few dozen newsletters, you can now reach new audiences, experiment with language, or build daily WhatsApp digests—all without spending on extra staff or software.\n\nThere’s no need to wait for Silicon Valley to “unlock” this for you. The tools are already here, and they work just as well in Nairobi as in New York.\n\n**Your practical takeaway**\n\nExport your archive. Paste it into ChatGPT or Claude. Ask: “What are my top stories, and how should I remix them?” Build a new issue in twenty minutes. If you want my code or templates, get in touch. This is the future for small teams—and it’s not complicated.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 This Week in AI News\n\n- Kenya’s Nation Media Group is trialling an AI-powered WhatsApp assistant for daily news summaries. Early tests are promising, especially for younger audiences.\n- Meta has rolled out a new version of its Llama model. African languages are still mostly absent. The wait for meaningful Swahili or Yoruba support continues.\n- DW Akademie published a new report showing small newsrooms using ChatGPT to automate basic reporting tasks. Some love it, some are frustrated by bland outputs and hallucinations.\n\n---\n\n## 🏠 What’s Happening at Develop AI\n\n- Our next free online workshop: “How to use ChatGPT to code your own newsroom tools.” Sign up link coming next week.\n- We’re expanding the Develop AI WhatsApp community. Invites are open for journalists in Southern and East Africa—reply to this newsletter if you want in.\n\nAll the best,\n\nPaul",

          "content": "The AI revolution is poised to reshape the workforce, and investors are buzzing. According to a report from PwC, nearly 60% of jobs will see substantial changes, with AI taking over a whopping 30% of tasks.\n\nThe excitement is palpable, especially in Silicon Valley. A study from Stanford shows that 40% of California's workforce is at risk of displacement due to AI. However, the message is clear: this is not just about losing jobs; it's about transforming them.\n\nThe AI market is projected to skyrocket. In 2023, it was valued at $86 billion; by 2030, that figure is expected to soar to $1.5 trillion. This growth is attracting a flood of capital. In Q1 2024 alone, AI startups raised $4.25 billion globally, with an impressive 83% of that coming from the US. This influx is not just about numbers; it's about innovation and potential.\n\nBut what does this mean for industries? The impact will vary. In the manufacturing sector, AI is set to enhance efficiency and precision. For healthcare, it promises better diagnostics and patient care. However, sectors like transportation and retail are bracing for more upheaval.\n\nThis shift isn't just about technology; it's about reskilling. A report from McKinsey emphasizes the need for a rapid upskilling of the workforce. Employees will need to adapt to new tools and processes to stay relevant.\n\nIn Africa, the potential for AI to drive economic growth is immense. A report from the Brookings Institution highlights that AI could add $1.5 trillion to Africa's economy by 2030. However, there's a caveat: for this to happen, investments in education and infrastructure are crucial.\n\nAs we look to 2026 and beyond, the message is clear: embrace the change. AI will transform our work lives, and those who adapt will thrive.\n\nThis week’s AI tool for you to use…\nAs a follow up to using Ollama to run your own LLM on your laptop,\nMistral\nis a new model that is open-source and available to everyone. This is a game-changer, because if you want to run an AI model that is not connected to the Internet and is not hosted by a third-party cloud provider, then you can download it and run it on your own computer.\nThis week’s AI tool for you to avoid…\nThe latest trend is to build your own LLM (like\nI have done\n) and then use it to provide the AI service you are selling to customers. The problem is, the quality of these “personal” LLMs can be drastically inferior to the major ones. If you are a business, you should consider sticking with well-established LLMs for tasks demanding high performance.\nIn the news…\nI am delighted to announce that Develop AI is now a member of the\nGlobal AI Media Coalition\n. The Coalition is a group of media organizations, journalists, and technologists dedicated to improving the reporting of AI and advancing the responsible development and use of AI in the media.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nWe are in a post AI world. This newsletter copied my own image prompt from last week to create the picture of rice and I asked it to use its “own” creativity. The result is above.\nSee you next week. All the best,\nDevelop AI\nis an innovative company that creates AI focused content, builds AI strategies for businesses and provides AI training.\nWatch our\npress conference\non AI and media from Cape Town.\nListen to\nDevelop Audio’s\ninvestigative podcasts.\nAnd read\nDevelop AI’s\ndaily newsletter on LinkedIn.\nContact us on\nWhatsApp\n.\nFollow us on\nX\n/\nThreads\n/\nTikTok\nand\nLinkedIn\n.\nThis newsletter is syndicated to millions of people on\nThe Daily Brief\nby\nThe Media\n.\nIf you aren’t subscribed to this newsletter,\nclick here\n.",

          "content": "# 2026 is coming for your job: The rise of AI in the workplace\n\n2026 is the year AI stops being an abstract threat and starts knocking on your office door. I can feel it. I was in Johannesburg last month, talking with editors at the Daily Maverick about their plans for next year. The anxiety was real. Everyone wanted to know: “Will my job make it through the next cycle of AI upgrades?”\n\nIt’s not just media. Every industry is getting the same existential memo. And it’s not hype—investors are openly predicting that 2026 will be the year AI comes for labour, not just in Silicon Valley but everywhere. (Here’s the piece from TechCrunch if you want to see what the money people are betting on: [Investors predict AI is coming for labor in 2026](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/).)\n\n---\n\n## The real story: AI isn’t just about job loss\n\nI’ve seen a lot of hand-wringing about AI “replacing” jobs. The truth is a little more complicated. Yes, repetitive, rules-based jobs are getting automated. If your job is to process data, fill in forms, or do basic analysis, the writing is on the wall. The bots are coming.\n\nBut here’s what almost nobody says out loud: AI creates new jobs, too. They just don’t look like the old ones. In media, I’ve watched newsrooms in Lagos and Nairobi pivot to hiring people who can manage AI workflows, build prompts, and evaluate machine output for bias or error. These jobs didn’t exist two years ago.\n\n> **AI lesson:** If you want to survive, you need to be learning how to work *with* AI, not just avoiding it.\n\nThe jobs that stick around? The ones involving complex problem-solving, creativity, or emotional intelligence. Editors who can spot a story AI misses. Journalists who can build trust in communities and verify information the bots scrape from the web. It’s the same in health, law, and education.\n\n---\n\n## The deeper issue: Transformation, not just attrition\n\nA lot of the conversation is still stuck on the idea that AI will “replace” humans. Wrong frame. AI is transforming the *nature* of work. Take podcasting. In Moldova, I saw newsrooms using ElevenLabs to generate synthetic voices for daily news briefings. But the audience noticed when the stories sounded robotic or tone-deaf to real events. The lesson: AI can draft, but humans still have to sense-check and add context.\n\nIn South Africa, I’ve helped a couple of outlets set up semi-automated newsletter workflows. The time saved is real. But it’s not about cutting staff. The goal is to free up journalists to do deeper reporting—investigations, podcasts, WhatsApp tip lines—while the AI handles the daily churn.\n\nThe best newsrooms aren’t firing people. They’re upskilling them. They’re teaching staff to use ChatGPT for research, but also running workshops on media ethics, context, and how to spot an AI hallucination from a mile away.\n\n---\n\n## Real examples: What’s actually happening now\n\n1. **In Nairobi**, The Elephant has started using AI to translate stories into Swahili and French. Human editors still do the final pass, but the AI gets them 80% of the way.\n2. **In Cape Town**, a small investigative team I worked with is building an archive search tool using open-source LLMs from Ollama. The journalists can now search decades of court filings in seconds—but they still have to call sources to check what’s real.\n3. **At DW Akademie’s recent workshop in Uganda**, the focus was on teaching community journalists how to use AI to summarise WhatsApp group chats, so they can spot trends without reading thousands of messages. Automation, but with a human in the loop.\n\n---\n\n## The Global South: Different risks, different opportunities\n\nHere’s what keeps me up at night. Most of the conversation about AI and jobs is still dominated by American and European voices. But the risks—and the opportunities—are different in Africa and the Global South.\n\nIf you’re in Lagos or Nairobi, you probably don’t have a giant HR department to retrain everyone. The threat isn’t just job loss, but being locked out of the new jobs entirely. The skills gap is real—and so is the infrastructure gap.\n\nBut there’s also a window for leapfrogging. African newsrooms are some of the fastest to adopt WhatsApp bots, automated translation, and local-language podcasting. I’ve seen more innovation in small, underfunded teams in Accra than in entire European newsrooms with ten times the budget.\n\nIf governments and funders step up—by investing in digital skills training, open-source tools, and decent internet—there’s a chance to build a new kind of workforce. But we need to move fast.\n\n---\n\n## What you should actually do\n\n- Audit your job. What do you do that AI could already do? What’s left that only you can do?\n- Start learning new tools—Cursor, ChatGPT, ElevenLabs—before your boss tells you to.\n- If you’re a decision-maker, invest in upskilling, not just cutting costs.\n- Push for a real social safety net. Universal basic income isn’t a Silicon Valley daydream; it might be the only way some people get through this.\n\n> **Takeaway:** AI isn’t coming for *all* jobs. It’s coming for the parts of your job that can be automated. Make sure what’s left is worth keeping.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 This Week in AI News\n\n- **AI Regulation:** Big tech is lobbying hard to water down new AI regulations in Europe and Asia. The fight is over who gets to decide what counts as “high-risk.” (Search: 'AI regulation news 2026')\n- **AI in Education:** Schools in Kenya and South Africa are starting to flag declining learning outcomes where AI “tutors” have replaced real teachers. The debate is heating up over how much automation is too much for the classroom. (Search: 'AI education impact 2026')\n\n---\n\n## 🏠 What’s Happening at Develop AI\n\nWe’ve been shortlisted for Best Podcasting Innovation at this year’s South African Podcast Awards. It’s a big deal for us, considering we started as a newsletter and now we’re competing with national broadcasters.\n\nI’ll also be speaking at the European University Institute in Florence on 30 November 2026. My panel is all about AI, podcasting, and what “European values” even mean when half the content you consume is generated by a bot. If you’re in Italy, come say hi.\n\nWe’re always building, always testing. If you want to see how AI can actually help your newsroom—not just replace people but build something new—reply to this email or join our WhatsApp Community.\n\nAll the best,\n\nPaul",

          "content": "# 2026 is coming for your job: The rise of AI in the workplace\n\n2026 is the year AI stops being an abstract threat and starts knocking on your office door. I can feel it. I was in Johannesburg last month, talking with editors at the Daily Maverick about their plans for next year. The anxiety was real. Everyone wanted to know: “Will my job make it through the next cycle of AI upgrades?”\n\nIt’s not just media. Every industry is getting the same existential memo. And it’s not hype—investors are openly predicting that 2026 will be the year AI comes for labour, not just in Silicon Valley but everywhere. (Here’s the piece from TechCrunch if you want to see what the money people are betting on: [Investors predict AI is coming for labor in 2026](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/).)\n\n---\n\n## The real story: AI isn’t just about job loss\n\nI’ve seen a lot of hand-wringing about AI “replacing” jobs. The truth is a little more complicated. Yes, repetitive, rules-based jobs are getting automated. If your job is to process data, fill in forms, or do basic analysis, the writing is on the wall. The bots are coming.\n\nBut here’s what almost nobody says out loud: AI creates new jobs, too. They just don’t look like the old ones. In media, I’ve watched newsrooms in Lagos and Nairobi pivot to hiring people who can manage AI workflows, build prompts, and evaluate machine output for bias or error. These jobs didn’t exist two years ago.\n\n> **AI lesson:** If you want to survive, you need to be learning how to work *with* AI, not just avoiding it.\n\nThe jobs that stick around? The ones involving complex problem-solving, creativity, or emotional intelligence. Editors who can spot a story AI misses. Journalists who can build trust in communities and verify information the bots scrape from the web. It’s the same in health, law, and education.\n\n---\n\n## The deeper issue: Transformation, not just attrition\n\nA lot of the conversation is still stuck on the idea that AI will “replace” humans. Wrong frame. AI is transforming the *nature* of work. Take podcasting. In Moldova, I saw newsrooms using ElevenLabs to generate synthetic voices for daily news briefings. But the audience noticed when the stories sounded robotic or tone-deaf to real events. The lesson: AI can draft, but humans still have to sense-check and add context.\n\nIn South Africa, I’ve helped a couple of outlets set up semi-automated newsletter workflows. The time saved is real. But it’s not about cutting staff. The goal is to free up journalists to do deeper reporting—investigations, podcasts, WhatsApp tip lines—while the AI handles the daily churn.\n\nThe best newsrooms aren’t firing people. They’re upskilling them. They’re teaching staff to use ChatGPT for research, but also running workshops on media ethics, context, and how to spot an AI hallucination from a mile away.\n\n---\n\n## Real examples: What’s actually happening now\n\n1. **In Nairobi**, The Elephant has started using AI to translate stories into Swahili and French. Human editors still do the final pass, but the AI gets them 80% of the way.\n2. **In Cape Town**, a small investigative team I worked with is building an archive search tool using open-source LLMs from Ollama. The journalists can now search decades of court filings in seconds—but they still have to call sources to check what’s real.\n3. **At DW Akademie’s recent workshop in Uganda**, the focus was on teaching community journalists how to use AI to summarise WhatsApp group chats, so they can spot trends without reading thousands of messages. Automation, but with a human in the loop.\n\n---\n\n## The Global South: Different risks, different opportunities\n\nHere’s what keeps me up at night. Most of the conversation about AI and jobs is still dominated by American and European voices. But the risks—and the opportunities—are different in Africa and the Global South.\n\nIf you’re in Lagos or Nairobi, you probably don’t have a giant HR department to retrain everyone. The threat isn’t just job loss, but being locked out of the new jobs entirely. The skills gap is real—and so is the infrastructure gap.\n\nBut there’s also a window for leapfrogging. African newsrooms are some of the fastest to adopt WhatsApp bots, automated translation, and local-language podcasting. I’ve seen more innovation in small, underfunded teams in Accra than in entire European newsrooms with ten times the budget.\n\nIf governments and funders step up—by investing in digital skills training, open-source tools, and decent internet—there’s a chance to build a new kind of workforce. But we need to move fast.\n\n---\n\n## What you should actually do\n\n- Audit your job. What do you do that AI could already do? What’s left that only you can do?\n- Start learning new tools—Cursor, ChatGPT, ElevenLabs—before your boss tells you to.\n- If you’re a decision-maker, invest in upskilling, not just cutting costs.\n- Push for a real social safety net. Universal basic income isn’t a Silicon Valley daydream; it might be the only way some people get through this.\n\n> **Takeaway:** AI isn’t coming for *all* jobs. It’s coming for the parts of your job that can be automated. Make sure what’s left is worth keeping.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 This Week in AI News\n\n- **AI Regulation:** Big tech is lobbying hard to water down new AI regulations in Europe and Asia. The fight is over who gets to decide what counts as “high-risk.” (Search: 'AI regulation news 2026')\n- **AI in Education:** Schools in Kenya and South Africa are starting to flag declining learning outcomes where AI “tutors” have replaced real teachers. The debate is heating up over how much automation is too much for the classroom. (Search: 'AI education impact 2026')\n\n---\n\n## 🏠 What’s Happening at Develop AI\n\nWe’ve been shortlisted for Best Podcasting Innovation at this year’s South African Podcast Awards. It’s a big deal for us, considering we started as a newsletter and now we’re competing with national broadcasters.\n\nI’ll also be speaking at the European University Institute in Florence on 30 November 2026. My panel is all about AI, podcasting, and what “European values” even mean when half the content you consume is generated by a bot. If you’re in Italy, come say hi.\n\nWe’re always building, always testing. If you want to see how AI can actually help your newsroom—not just replace people but build something new—reply to this email or join our WhatsApp Community.\n\nAll the best,\n\nPaul",

          "content": "# Investors predict AI is coming for labor in 2026\n\nAI is coming for your job. Or at least, that’s what the investors are betting on. I’ve spent a lot of time in newsrooms over the last year, running workshops from Arusha to Johannesburg to Copenhagen. The mood is the same wherever I go. Excitement, yes, but also a gnawing sense of dread. The question always comes up: who actually benefits when AI gets woven into the fabric of our work?\n\n**The investor predictions**\n\nLet’s start with what’s being said out loud. Investors are openly predicting that 2026 will be the year AI stops being a cute productivity tool and starts making actual humans redundant. Jason Mendel (who I’ve never met, but whose predictions are everywhere right now) says it bluntly: “2026 will be the year of agents as software expands from making humans more productive to automating work itself” [[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/)]. That’s not just about replacing the person in the call centre. It’s about automating the knowledge worker—the journalist, the editor, the researcher.\n\nMarell Evans, another investor with a knack for stating the obvious, puts it this way: “We’ll see more human labor get cut and layoffs will continue to aggressively impact the U.S. employment rate” [[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/)]. The tech world loves to talk about “efficiency.” But what that usually means is fewer people getting paid to do the same amount of work.\n\n**The core issue**\n\nI’ve been in enough editorial meetings (both in Africa and Europe) to know that “efficiency” is a loaded word. It’s the excuse for shrinking teams and hiring freezes. But now, with AI, it’s not just the junior roles on the chopping block. Generative AI is getting good enough to write press releases, summarise reports, even draft entire newsletters. You can plug your data into ChatGPT or use something like Ollama to run smaller models right on your laptop. I’ve done it. It works. It’s not perfect, but it’s getting closer every month.\n\nThe real kicker, though, is that AI isn’t just coming for the “boring” parts of the job. It’s starting to nibble at the creative stuff, too. I’ve seen people use AI to create podcast scripts, generate news headlines, even build entire social media calendars. The result? One person can now do the work of three, if they’re smart about how they use these tools.\n\n**Deep analysis: beneath the hype**\n\nThere’s a lot of talk about “reskilling” and “new opportunities.” That’s the official line every time a new round of layoffs hits. But the truth is that the gap between those who can leverage AI and those who can’t is widening fast. In my workshops, I see it every time: some journalists are hungry to experiment. Others are paralysed, worried that every new tool is just another step toward their own obsolescence.\n\nAnd there’s another uncomfortable truth: even if you become an AI “power user,” you’re still playing in someone else’s playground. The models get updated, the APIs change, the rules shift. What was a competitive edge last month becomes table stakes overnight.\n\n**Real examples: names, tools, lessons**\n\nI’ve worked with newsrooms in South Africa where editors are using tools like Cursor to speed up their coding. In Lagos, I met a team using ElevenLabs to turn text into audio news for WhatsApp distribution. None of these are Silicon Valley unicorns. They’re small outfits, running on tight budgets, but they’re moving faster than most of the big legacy media brands.\n\n> **AI lesson**: The best use of AI right now isn’t to replace people, but to let small teams punch above their weight. If you’re in a newsroom, don’t wait for management to hand down an “AI strategy.” Start automating repetitive tasks yourself. Build your own workflows. Share what you learn.\n\n**Africa/Global South perspective**\n\nThis isn’t just a Western problem. In Africa, the stakes are even higher. Most newsrooms don’t have the luxury of cutting staff—they’re already running lean. What I’ve seen in Nairobi and Accra is a scramble to adapt, not a cull. Editors want to know how to use AI to cover more stories, in more languages, with the same handful of freelancers. There’s real opportunity here for African media to leapfrog old workflows, but only if they get access to the right tools and training.\n\nThe danger, though, is that if we don’t invest in local skills, we’ll just end up consuming AI-generated content built and trained elsewhere. That’s a recipe for irrelevance.\n\n**Practical takeaway**\n\nIf you’re worried about your job, don’t wait for the axe to fall. Start learning how these tools actually work. Pick one task you hate (transcribing interviews, building social posts, whatever) and automate it. Share the results. If your newsroom isn’t talking about AI, start the conversation.\n\n> **Key takeaway**: AI isn’t coming for your job. The people who know how to use AI are.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 News Roundup\n\n- [Instagram’s Adam Mosseri says you can’t trust your eyes anymore](https://www.theverge.com/news/852124/adam-mosseri-ai-images-video-instagram) – Instagram’s boss reflects on the end of “real” content as AI-generated images flood the platform.\n- [Wired: AI Labor Is Boring.

Here’s what’s working for the people I’ve worked with:\n\n1. Use Ollama to run open-source models on your own hardware. No need for an internet connection.\n2. Automate translations and audio summaries with ElevenLabs.\n3. Build small WhatsApp bots to share news with your community. No coding background needed—just patience.\n\nIf you want to see how these tools fit together, contact me. Or, better yet, tell me what you’re building. The best ideas are coming out of newsrooms with nothing to lose.\n\nAll the best,\n\nPaul",

          "content": "# Investors predict AI is coming for labor in 2026\n\nAI is coming for your job. Or at least, that’s what the investors are betting on. I’ve spent a lot of time in newsrooms over the last year, running workshops from Arusha to Johannesburg to Copenhagen. The mood is the same wherever I go. Excitement, yes, but also a gnawing sense of dread. The question always comes up: who actually benefits when AI gets woven into the fabric of our work?\n\n**The investor predictions**\n\nLet’s start with what’s being said out loud. Investors are openly predicting that 2026 will be the year AI stops being a cute productivity tool and starts making actual humans redundant. Jason Mendel (who I’ve never met, but whose predictions are everywhere right now) says it bluntly: “2026 will be the year of agents as software expands from making humans more productive to automating work itself” [[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/)]. That’s not just about replacing the person in the call centre. It’s about automating the knowledge worker—the journalist, the editor, the researcher.\n\nMarell Evans, another investor with a knack for stating the obvious, puts it this way: “We’ll see more human labor get cut and layoffs will continue to aggressively impact the U.S. employment rate” [[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/)]. The tech world loves to talk about “efficiency.” But what that usually means is fewer people getting paid to do the same amount of work.\n\n**The core issue**\n\nI’ve been in enough editorial meetings (both in Africa and Europe) to know that “efficiency” is a loaded word. It’s the excuse for shrinking teams and hiring freezes. But now, with AI, it’s not just the junior roles on the chopping block. Generative AI is getting good enough to write press releases, summarise reports, even draft entire newsletters. You can plug your data into ChatGPT or use something like Ollama to run smaller models right on your laptop. I’ve done it. It works. It’s not perfect, but it’s getting closer every month.\n\nThe real kicker, though, is that AI isn’t just coming for the “boring” parts of the job. It’s starting to nibble at the creative stuff, too. I’ve seen people use AI to create podcast scripts, generate news headlines, even build entire social media calendars. The result? One person can now do the work of three, if they’re smart about how they use these tools.\n\n**Deep analysis: beneath the hype**\n\nThere’s a lot of talk about “reskilling” and “new opportunities.” That’s the official line every time a new round of layoffs hits. But the truth is that the gap between those who can leverage AI and those who can’t is widening fast. In my workshops, I see it every time: some journalists are hungry to experiment. Others are paralysed, worried that every new tool is just another step toward their own obsolescence.\n\nAnd there’s another uncomfortable truth: even if you become an AI “power user,” you’re still playing in someone else’s playground. The models get updated, the APIs change, the rules shift. What was a competitive edge last month becomes table stakes overnight.\n\n**Real examples: names, tools, lessons**\n\nI’ve worked with newsrooms in South Africa where editors are using tools like Cursor to speed up their coding. In Lagos, I met a team using ElevenLabs to turn text into audio news for WhatsApp distribution. None of these are Silicon Valley unicorns. They’re small outfits, running on tight budgets, but they’re moving faster than most of the big legacy media brands.\n\n> **AI lesson**: The best use of AI right now isn’t to replace people, but to let small teams punch above their weight. If you’re in a newsroom, don’t wait for management to hand down an “AI strategy.” Start automating repetitive tasks yourself. Build your own workflows. Share what you learn.\n\n**Africa/Global South perspective**\n\nThis isn’t just a Western problem. In Africa, the stakes are even higher. Most newsrooms don’t have the luxury of cutting staff—they’re already running lean. What I’ve seen in Nairobi and Accra is a scramble to adapt, not a cull. Editors want to know how to use AI to cover more stories, in more languages, with the same handful of freelancers. There’s real opportunity here for African media to leapfrog old workflows, but only if they get access to the right tools and training.\n\nThe danger, though, is that if we don’t invest in local skills, we’ll just end up consuming AI-generated content built and trained elsewhere. That’s a recipe for irrelevance.\n\n**Practical takeaway**\n\nIf you’re worried about your job, don’t wait for the axe to fall. Start learning how these tools actually work. Pick one task you hate (transcribing interviews, building social posts, whatever) and automate it. Share the results. If your newsroom isn’t talking about AI, start the conversation.\n\n> **Key takeaway**: AI isn’t coming for your job. The people who know how to use AI are.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 News Roundup\n\n- [Instagram’s Adam Mosseri says you can’t trust your eyes anymore](https://www.theverge.com/news/852124/adam-mosseri-ai-images-video-instagram) – Instagram’s boss reflects on the end of “real” content as AI-generated images flood the platform.\n- [Wired: AI Labor Is Boring.

Here’s what’s working for the people I’ve worked with:\n\n1. Use Ollama to run open-source models on your own hardware. No need for an internet connection.\n2. Automate translations and audio summaries with ElevenLabs.\n3. Build small WhatsApp bots to share news with your community. No coding background needed—just patience.\n\nIf you want to see how these tools fit together, contact me. Or, better yet, tell me what you’re building. The best ideas are coming out of newsrooms with nothing to lose.\n\nAll the best,\n\nPaul",

          "content": "# How to build your own AI model and trap it in your house\n\nDevelop AI has built an app called Letter+ that helps you write your newsletter every day.\n\n---\n\nI have a confession: this is the last newsletter I’ll write fully by hand. The next one, I’m handing over to my own AI. Not OpenAI, not Google—an AI trained on my own writing, trapped (happily) inside my home, only answering to me.\n\nThe idea started when I got tired of ChatGPT churning out bland newsletter drafts that sounded like every other AI-generated update on the planet. You know the style: “In today’s world, AI is transforming the landscape…” No, thank you. I wanted something that could sound like me, write like me, and make the same dumb jokes I do about podcasting in Tanzania or crashing my code in Lagos.\n\nSo I built Letter+. It’s an app (free, on the Apple App Store, Google Play, or [the web version](https://letterplus.app)) that lets you train an AI on your actual newsletters. It learns your voice, your quirks, your bad habits. Then, every morning, you sit down and chat with it—“What should I write today?”—and it drafts your newsletter in your own style. You can edit, tweak, or just send it off. That’s the dream. Here’s what I’ve learned building it, and how you can build your own AI model—without letting it run wild in the world.\n\n## 1. You need a vision (and a use-case that isn’t just “because AI”)\n\nDon’t just build an AI because it’s cool. You need to know exactly what you want it to do. For me, it was about cutting out the boring parts of newsletter writing—summarising stats, reworking intros, checking for broken links. For you, maybe it’s drafting daily news summaries for your WhatsApp group, or writing podcast scripts in your voice. Pick a problem you have every day, not just a thing that seems interesting in theory. The best AIs I’ve seen are deeply practical. Letter+ is designed for newsletter writers and people who just want their own voice, not a generic one.\n\n## 2. Use AI for the boring parts—leave the thinking to yourself\n\nThe magic of AI coding isn’t in the big, splashy features. It’s in the tedium. I used ChatGPT, Cursor, and Ollama to write the code that formats HTML tables, manages newsletter archives, and checks for duplicate links. None of this is sexy. But it’s what takes up your time. The faster you hand off the boring parts, the more time you have for the stuff only you can do—like telling stories about Tanzanian podcasting or how you burned through your Bolt credits in a single afternoon.\n\n> **Lesson:** “AI is best at generating the code you never wanted to write yourself.”\n\nI’ve been through this before—spending hours asking AI dev tools to generate a signup form or debug endless loops, only to realise the real work is in deciding what those forms should look like in the first place. You can’t outsource vision, just the grunt work.\n\n## 3. Be ready to debug (it’s faster, but never frictionless)\n\nAI coding is not magic. It’s faster, but it’s also messier. The app spits out working code 80% of the time. The other 20%? You’re chasing bugs through a maze of AI hallucinations. I keep a running list of “AI bugs” that make no sense to a human developer—random variables, missing imports, code that works on one machine and bursts into flames on another.\n\nIf you’re not comfortable debugging, you’ll get stuck. But here’s the upside: every time you fix an AI bug, you learn something. You start to understand the limits of these models, and you take back a bit of control from the hype machine.\n\nI’ve written about this before—how tools like Bolt and Cursor let you build a prototype in an afternoon, but getting it production-ready is a slog. No-code is great for demos, but if you want something that actually works, you’ll need to peek under the hood eventually.\n\n## 4. Lock it down—why I’m keeping my model “trapped” at home\n\nEveryone’s talking about building huge AI models and letting them loose on the internet. That’s not my style. I want my AI to live on my laptop, not on some remote server. Partly for privacy (I don’t want my emails training a Silicon Valley ad engine), but mostly for control. If it gets weird, I can delete it. If it gets good, I can make it better.\n\nThere’s a movement towards “personal AIs” that live with you, learn from you, and don’t phone home to corporate HQ. This is especially important for African and Global South users who have seen their data harvested and monetised by every platform under the sun. I want an AI that works for me—not the other way around.\n\n## 5. What does this mean for Africa, for small media, for you?\n\nIn Nairobi, I watched a newsroom build a WhatsApp bot that summarises local news in Swahili. In Lagos, a team used ElevenLabs to create a daily AI radio bulletin. These aren’t Silicon Valley projects—they’re small, personal, and deeply local. The lesson: you don’t need a million dollars, or a team of PhDs, to build something useful. You need a clear goal, some patience, and the willingness to get your hands dirty with the debugging.\n\nThe cost is coming down. The tools are getting better. If you want to build your own AI model—one that’s actually useful, that speaks your language, and that doesn’t sell you out—you can start today.\n\n> **Takeaway:** “Start with a real problem, use AI for the grunt work, and keep your model close. Don’t wait for someone else to build the tool you need.”\n\nIf you want to try Letter+, you can download it now or use the [web version](https://letterplus.app). I’ll be adding a feature soon to upload your old newsletters so the AI can learn your style better. Let me know what you build. Or what breaks. I want to hear it all.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 This Week in AI News\n\n- Instagram boss Adam Mosseri says the age of “infinite synthetic content” is here, and you can’t trust your eyes anymore. He’s pushing for labelling AI content, surfacing credibility signals, and ranking for originality. [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/852124/adam-mosseri-ai-images-video-instagram)\n- Erotic chatbots are now big business, with platforms like Candy.AI and Joi letting people generate synthetic “companions” for a monthly fee. The Mona Lisa bot alone has logged 800,000+ chats. [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/expired-tired-wired-sexy-chatbots/)\n- Investors predict AI is coming for labour in 2026, but no one knows what the actual impact on jobs will be. Uncertainty is now the only certainty. [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/)\n\n---\n\n## 🏠 What's Happening at Develop AI\n\nWe’re ramping up fast. I’m proud to be part of the United News Network’s training programme on AI and podcasting, working with journalists across the continent.\n\nNext month, I’ll be in Romania helping fantastic newsrooms build out their AI strategies—can’t wait for the collaboration.\n\nI also ran a workshop on AI and investigative journalism at the BIRN Summer School in Serbia. A huge thank you to the team there for the incredible work they’re doing on the ground.\n\nAnd the big news: Develop AI is now fully operational in the UK, with a base in London. More to come—watch this space.\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading. Try out Letter+, tell me what you think, and join our [WhatsApp Community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JOINLINK). See you next week.\n\nAll the best,\n\nPaul",

          "content": "# This is how AI will change newsletters\n\n*After months of hard work, we have built a newsletter podcast app that uses AI to create content. The process was not without its challenges, but the results are promising.*\n\nI’ve spent most of the last year thinking about how to make newsletters more useful, less repetitive, and a lot more fun for journalists. And after months of trial and error, Letter+ is finally here. It’s an AI-powered app to help you write, record, and publish newsletters and podcasts—without needing a studio, a huge team, or even a microphone.\n\n**1. What inspired the creation of the app**\n\nThe idea for Letter+ was born on a baking hot day in Zanzibar. I was working with DW Akademie, running a workshop for local newsrooms on AI and media. One publisher told me he wanted to experiment with AI but was worried about losing the human touch. That stuck with me. Most AI tools for media either spit out generic summaries or promise “content automation” that no real journalist actually wants to use.\n\nSo, I wanted to build something different. Not a tool that writes for you and forgets your voice, but one that helps you shape your newsletter, podcast, or social posts while keeping you in the loop. The goal: a service journalists would actually want to use, especially in places like Africa where budgets are tight and new ideas spread fast.\n\n**2. The tech behind the app and the challenges it faced during development**\n\nLetter+ is built on top of OpenAI’s models and APIs. (Yes, I’ve tried all the alternatives. This is what actually works.) The process wasn’t smooth. First off, there’s the cost. If you’re using AI to generate dozens of newsletters or podcasts, you need to watch your API costs or you’ll burn through your budget before you finish your first batch.\n\nThen there’s the storage problem. I wanted users to be able to save voice notes, scripts, and finished audio—ideally forever. Turns out, storing large files for every user is expensive. So now, Letter+ deletes old files after a short window. Not ideal, but necessary.\n\nThe biggest challenge was voice. I wanted journalists to be able to record a voice note, have the app transcribe it, polish the script with AI, and then generate audio that sounds like them. But cloning voices is either extremely expensive, or capped at ridiculously low limits. For now, the app lets you pick from a range of synthetic voices (some are scarily realistic), but your own cloned voice isn’t an option. Yet.\n\nThe other snag? Editing. AI-generated scripts can be bland or go off on tangents. I built in a preview-and-edit step so you can tweak the text before it becomes audio or gets published. It’s not perfect, but it means you don’t end up with a newsletter that sounds like an auto-translated press release. This is a win.\n\n**3. The vision for its future and its potential impact on media**\n\nLetter+ is designed for journalists in Africa and the wider Global South. I want to distribute it for free to newsrooms and independent writers who can’t afford expensive tools but need to reach their audiences. The idea is to let anyone turn their reporting, interviews, or ideas into newsletters and podcasts—fast. I’ll be piloting Letter+ with a handful of journalists in South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya over the next few months. If you want to be part of it, reply to this email.\n\n> **Takeaway:**  \n> The future of content creation in media isn’t about replacing journalists with AI. It’s about giving them tools to do more, faster, and reach people where they actually are—WhatsApp, email, and voice.\n\nThere is real potential here. If you’re in a small newsroom, you can use Letter+ to launch a daily news podcast, a WhatsApp bulletin, or a newsletter without hiring extra staff. If you’re already running a big operation, use it to experiment or free up your team to focus on reporting instead of formatting emails.\n\nThe next step is seeing what you will build with it. I want to see more African voices—and more journalists everywhere—using AI to tell better, more relevant stories.\n\n---\n\n## This Week in AI News\n\n- Lots of interest around how AI language models handle African languages. Recent workshops I’ve attended show that most models still struggle with isiZulu, Yoruba, and Amharic. This means local media needs to keep pushing for better representation and training data in these languages.\n- Newsrooms using AI tools to create content are no longer rare. In Nigeria, Premium Times has started experimenting with AI-generated summaries for WhatsApp news briefs. In South Africa, Daily Maverick is testing AI to help with research and interview prep. The tools aren’t perfect, but the momentum is real.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Happening at Develop AI\n\nLetter+ is now the focus for all of Develop AI. This app is going to transform how we do newsletters, podcasts, and social news. It’s been a long road of building, testing, and fixing, but I’m genuinely excited to open it up to you.\n\nOn the consulting side, I’ve just finished a round of sessions with media organisations in North Macedonia, helping them figure out how to implement AI in their newsrooms. Thanks to DW Akademie for making that possible. It’s always energising to see the same questions and hurdles—how do we keep our editorial voice? How do we train our teams?—being asked in Skopje as in Nairobi or Cape Town.\n\nIf you want early access to Letter+, or you want to chat about AI training for your newsroom, reply to this email.\n\nSee you next week.\n\nAll the best,  \nPaul\n\npaul@developai.co.za | [Join our WhatsApp community](https://wa.me/message/NEWLINK)  \nPhysically based in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nIf you aren’t subscribed to this newsletter, you can do so [here](https://www.developai.co.za).

I have just finished building a completely AI focused app that will allow people to create their own podcasts (with AI generated voices, music and sound) along with a complete newsletter. And I want to give it away to journalists and podcasters in Africa for free. This letter will explain the costs (there are some) and how anyone can create a completely AI generated newsletter and podcast in a few easy steps. I should note the app is called Letter+, and this is an early warning that it will be available for all in a few weeks.

The plan is to be open about how AI is being used in the creation of this newsletter and to document what works and what doesn’t.\nPhysically I’m in Cape Town, South Africa. But I’m also at\nDevelop Audio\n,\nDevelop Media\nand\nThe Citizen Justice Network\n.\nImage created with Ideogram\nEveryone is talking about job losses due to AI. Here’s what you need to know and how the media can respond.\nInvestors predict AI is coming for labor in 2026 (\nTechCrunch\n). They are claiming that as much as 11.7% of jobs are vulnerable to automation. These numbers feel correct, but also like we are well into the AI jobapocalypse already. This year is going to be spent wrestling with the gap between what is automated and what is not and the people who are going to suffer are the ones who can’t bridge those gaps.\nI’ve said this before, but I’m going to rely heavily on\nJigx\nin 2026 to build apps. This is going to be a big part of my plan for the year: to learn how to use Jigx to take my ideas for apps and put them into the world. I have a long list of ideas for apps, some with AI and some without, and I am going to use Jigx to create them, write about the process in this newsletter and then share the results with all of you. I have no affiliation with Jigx, I’m just obsessed with how they are simplifying app creation to the point where anyone can do it.\nThe fight between jobs and AI workers is going to be about who can triage AI tools the best. This is what I wrote about in the\nfirst edition\nof Develop AI: the people who are going to survive this transition are the people who don’t just use AI tools, but use all the AI tools available to them and combine them into workflows that make them more productive.\nThe problem is everyone is using the same tools, but not everyone is going to progress at the same speed. The people who are going to hold onto their jobs are the ones who can keep pace with the tools, who can spot when a new tool is better than the one they are using and can constantly rejig their workflow.\nI’m excited about the possibility that this will create a new type of work: instead of being a specialist in a particular field, you’ll be a specialist in using AI tools to do that field. This will be a new type of worker, one who is constantly learning and adapting to new tools and new ways of working.\nBut a problem is that the tools are going to keep getting better and better. And the people who can’t keep up are going to be left behind. The question is how do we help those people? How do we make sure that they are not left behind? The answer is going to have to be through education. We need to make sure that people are constantly learning and adapting to new tools and new ways of working. And we need to make sure that they are not afraid to ask for help.\nA good example of this is\nAdobe Firefly\n. When it launched in 2023 it was a tool for creating images from text prompts. It was impressive, but it was a single tool. Now it is a suite of tools that allows you to create images, videos, logos, animations, audio and 3D models. It is a complete creative suite and it is going to put a lot of people out of work. But it is also going to create a lot of new jobs. The question is how do we make sure that the people who are put out of work are the ones who get the new jobs?\nWe are going to need to create a culture of constant learning and adaptation. We are going to need to make sure that people are not afraid to ask for help. And we are going to need to make sure that people are not afraid to fail. Because the people who are going to succeed in this new world are the ones who are constantly learning, constantly adapting and constantly failing.\nHow AI is going to help the media in 2026\nI’m going to be spending a lot more time talking to journalists and media organisations about how they can use AI in a responsible way to secure their futures. If you would like me to talk to your organisation (either in-person or online) about how to implement AI tools into your workflows then\ndrop me a line\n. I’m also going to be offering training sessions around the world (watch this space for details).\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter?\nI used ChatGPT to generate the image above. However, I used\nIdeogram\nfor the image in our letter to premium subscribers. It is a free tool and I was impressed with the result.\nSee you next week.\nDevelop Al\nis a completely independent newsletter about AI for journalists and media professionals.

          "content": "# Is AI going to take your job in 2026?\n\n*Everyone is talking about job losses due to AI. Here’s what you need to know and how the media can respond.*\n\nInvestors predict AI is coming for labor in 2026. This year is going to be spent wrestling with the gap between what is automated and what is not, and the people who are going to suffer are the ones who aren’t paying attention. Everyone is talking about job losses due to AI. Here’s what you need to know and how the media can respond.\n\nA recent MIT study estimates that 11.7% of jobs could already be automated using AI, a figure that’s only going to grow [TechCrunch AI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/). If you work in tech, media, or frankly any sector where a computer can do the heavy lifting, it can feel like the ground is shifting under our feet, but it’s not all doom and gloom. Some argue that AI will kill more jobs than it creates, but the reality is more complex. The real challenge isn’t just about losing jobs—it’s about how fast things are changing and who is prepared to adapt. So what does this mean for your job, and what can the media—and the rest of us—actually do about it?\n\nThe first thing to understand: not all jobs are equally exposed. Routine, repetitive roles—think data entry, certain administrative posts, and even some technical support jobs—are already being eyed by investors as the first to go [TechCrunch AI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/). If your day-to-day rarely throws you a curveball, you may want to start thinking about how your skills fit into a world where AI can do the predictable stuff faster and cheaper. There’s no denying some jobs will disappear. But this isn’t just a story about disappearing work—it’s also about new opportunities and the human skills machines can’t match. I get why people are worried—automation isn’t just a tech story, it’s a human one. That brings us to the second big point: how individuals and industries reposition themselves as automation creeps in.\n\nAdaptability is the new job security. Take Bari Keenam, who turned 200 job rejections a month into a competitive sport, learning new skills with every setback. He calls it “serial learning” [TechCabal](https://techcabal.com/2025/12/31/how-bari-keenam-made-job-rejections-a-sport/). This approach is less about mastering one thing and more about getting comfortable with constant change. If you’re not learning, you’re standing still—and in 2026, that’s a risky move. In my view, the people who will thrive aren’t necessarily the most technical, but those who keep moving, keep learning, and keep experimenting—even if that means failing a lot along the way. But this isn’t just about individuals. The way we all see work, truth, and even reality is being reshaped by AI.\n\nAI isn’t just rewriting job descriptions—it’s making us question what’s real and what’s not. As Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, puts it: “For most of my life I could safely assume photographs or videos were largely accurate captures of moments that happened. This is clearly no longer the case and it’s going to take us years to adapt” [The Verge - AI](https://www.theverge.com/news/852124/adam-mosseri-ai-images-video-instagram). This challenge goes beyond deepfakes or manipulated media—it’s about how we verify truth in a world where the line between human and machine output is increasingly hard to see. For media professionals, this is a call to double down on trust, transparency, and skills that AI can’t easily automate: investigation, empathy, and storytelling. So, what should you actually do as 2026 approaches?\n\nHere’s what matters as we look ahead. Audit your daily tasks: what’s repetitive, and what’s uniquely human? Invest in skills that emphasize adaptability—think critical thinking, cross-disciplinary learning, and creativity. For media professionals: build audience trust by being transparent about your methods and vigilant about verifying information. **AI will change the job market, but it’s not going to eliminate the need for humans. In fact, it might make the human element—the messy, creative, unpredictable stuff—more valuable than ever.**\n\nChange is coming, and it’s coming fast. But with the right mindset and a willingness to keep learning, there’s every reason to believe you’ll land on your feet.  \n\nIf you’re in media—or any field facing AI disruption—this is your moment to double down on what makes you human. Let’s get ready for 2026, together.",

They unveiled their third-generation Ryzen AI processors, pushing us towards a future where developing skills might become essential for everyone. As technology evolves, we find ourselves on the brink of a new era. But what does this mean for you and me? \n\nAccording to a [Reuters report](https://www.reuters.com/business/amd-unveils-new-chips-ces-event-las-vegas-2026-01-06/), AMD's unveiling of the third generation of its Ryzen AI processors is not just another upgrade. These processors, the Ryzen 8040HS and 8040U, represent a significant leap forward. Imagine having the power of 12 AI cores at your fingertips, delivering up to 81 TOPs of AI performance. This impressive advancement isn't just about having more power; it's about redefining what our devices can do. Twelve AI cores. Eighty-one teraflops. Power redefined.\n\nThese processors aren't just upgrades; they're a leap forward. What makes them truly remarkable is their ability to handle AI workloads efficiently. By moving specific tasks to dedicated AI cores, these chips promise not only enhanced performance but also improved battery life. For those of us constantly on the move, this is a real benefit. How will this affect the way we use our devices every day? Practically speaking, these processors mean longer battery life, but philosophically, they challenge us to rethink our relationship with technology.\n\nSo, what does this mean for the everyday computer user? The days of vibing through code might be numbered. As these technologies become more integrated into our daily lives, we might see a shift in how we approach digital literacy and its importance in various fields. I believe that embracing these changes could open up new opportunities for learning and growth. Objectively, the advancements are impressive, but personally, I find them inspiring. While the pace of change can be daunting, it also brings new possibilities for innovation.\n\nLooking ahead, we can only imagine the possibilities. Could this technology redefine how we interact with our devices? As we navigate these uncharted waters, there is a chance that more industries will demand a basic understanding of development skills from their workers. This isn't just about staying relevant in your current job; it's about preparing for a future where technology and development are more intertwined than ever. As these technologies continue to evolve, staying ahead means being ready to adapt and learn continuously.\n\nAs we stand on the brink of technological transformation, the question remains: are we ready to become developers in our own right? Embrace the possibilities, and let's stay ahead together.",

          "content": "# The future of AI is going to depend on your hardware\n\n*PC chips are going to need to get better and we are all going to have to pay for it.*\n\nI remember when RAM was a birthday treat. Because simply better hardware meant better games. But as a byproduct, you learnt how to open up your Pentium and where to fit in the RAM and how the other components worked together. Just as those early days of tinkering taught us the value of better hardware, today's advancements in AI demand even greater performance from our chips. Yet, it's not just nostalgia; today's AI innovations demand more than ever from our processors.\n\nAI's appetite for processing power is insatiable. It’s not just a craving; it’s a necessity. The complexity of algorithms and the vast amounts of data they consume require computing resources on a scale that our current hardware can barely handle. This shortfall isn't just a technical hiccup; it’s a bottleneck for innovation. Today's chips, though powerful, are often the bottlenecks in AI innovation. As we push AI to learn and adapt faster, the pressure mounts on hardware to keep pace.\n\nEmerging technologies in chip design offer a glimpse of what's possible. Think AI cores and neural processing units redefining speed. These innovations promise to revolutionize the way AI processes information, making our current tech seem almost pedestrian by comparison. The advancements hint at a future where the limitations of today's hardware are a distant memory, and the potential of AI is fully realized.\n\nCompanies like AMD and Intel are already paving the road ahead. Their efforts to integrate AI-specific capabilities into their chips are setting new benchmarks. Twelve AI cores. Eighty-one teraflops. Power redefined. These figures aren't just impressive; they’re a testament to a future where hardware is designed from the ground up to support AI's unique demands. This shift in design philosophy marks a significant departure from past practices.\n\nBut this leap forward comes with a price tag. As chip technology evolves, the cost of these advancements will inevitably be passed on to consumers. Yet, while consumers may feel the pinch, the investment is a step towards unprecedented capabilities. The benefits of faster, more efficient AI could transform industries, from healthcare to finance, offering returns that far outweigh the initial costs. The economic implications are vast, affecting consumers and businesses alike.\n\nUltimately, the investment in hardware is an investment in our future. As we push the boundaries of what's possible, every upgrade is a step towards a smarter world. The tech industry stands on the cusp of a new era, where the synergy between hardware and AI will drive innovation like never before. In a world where technology is the heartbeat of innovation, we stand on the precipice of incredible change. Let’s embrace the future, one chip at a time.\n\nSo, as we look forward, it's crucial to consider how these advancements might impact our everyday lives. The journey into the future of AI is not just a technological evolution but a profound shift in how we interact with the world. Let's keep an eye on these developments, as they promise to redefine our experience and capabilities in ways we can only begin to imagine.",

          "content": "# The future of AI is going to depend on your hardware\n\n*PC chips are going to need to get better and we are all going to have to pay for it.*\n\nI remember when RAM was a birthday treat. Because simply better hardware meant better games. But as a byproduct, you learnt how to open up your Pentium and where to fit in the RAM and how the other components connected. Today, the stakes are higher, and it's not just about better games but the future of AI.\n\n## AI and Hardware: An Essential Symbiosis\n\nAI isn't just software; it's a symbiotic relationship with hardware. As we look at the demands AI places on hardware, it's clear there's a pressing need for innovation. Our current PC chips are the backbone of AI advancements. They are the unsung heroes driving complex algorithms and machine learning tasks. However, these chips need to keep evolving. Without significant improvements in processing power and efficiency, AI can't reach its full potential. Imagine AI as a race car, and your PC chip as the engine. Without a powerful engine, the car just won't perform.\n\n## The Cost of Progress\n\nWith great power comes great cost, and consumers will inevitably feel the pinch. Investment in new tech isn't just an option; it's becoming a necessity. The financial implications for consumers and developers are significant.

          "content": "## The Future of AI is Going to Depend on Your Hardware\n\nI remember when RAM was a birthday treat. Because simply better hardware meant better games. But as a byproduct, you learned how to open up your Pentium and where to fit in the RAM and how the other components fit together. That same curiosity about hardware is now at the forefront of how AI will evolve.\n\nToday's AI demands are pushing the boundaries of what our current hardware can support. AI needs more. More power, more speed, more capability. It's like trying to run a marathon with shoes that are falling apart. Our existing hardware is struggling to keep up with the intensive processing requirements of modern AI applications. This isn't just a problem for techies. It's a reality check for everyone who relies on AI, from journalists like us to industries across the spectrum.\n\nTo understand why hardware is at a crossroads, consider the latest developments in AI chip technology. Companies are investing heavily in creating AI-specific chips that offer better performance and efficiency. According to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt/), AMD announced new AI-powered PC chips designed to significantly enhance computing power. These chips aren't just faster; they're smarter. They leverage machine learning and neural network capabilities to process complex tasks more efficiently. The result? A potential leap forward for AI applications, but also a reminder that we can't rest on our laurels when it comes to hardware.\n\nAs these advancements come to market, we all face a decision. It's not just about buying a new gadget; it's about investing in a new era. The financial implications are significant. Upgrading to the latest hardware doesn't come cheap. As [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/08/15/nvidia-ai-chip-cost) notes, the cost of cutting-edge AI chips isn't trivial. For consumers in Africa and the Global South, where tech budgets are often tighter, this presents a challenge. It's a stark reminder that while technology promises great leaps forward, it can also widen existing inequalities.\n\nAs we stand on the brink of a new era in AI, the choices we make today will shape the technologies of tomorrow. What will you choose? It's a question worth pondering as we consider our next hardware upgrade. Staying informed about technological progress isn't just a luxury; it's a necessity. The rapid pace of AI development means that what's cutting-edge today might be obsolete tomorrow. But that's the nature of the beast. Balancing skepticism with curiosity, we continue to watch and learn.\n\nIn this evolving landscape, the role of hardware cannot be overstated. It's the foundation upon which AI builds its future. So, next time you're considering an upgrade, think beyond the price tag. You're not just buying a piece of equipment; you're investing in the future of AI.",

          "content": "## The future of AI is going to depend on your hardware\n\nPC chips are going to need to get better and we are all going to have to pay for it. As AI continues to evolve, the demand for more powerful hardware becomes paramount. This isn't just a tech industry issue; it affects every one of us who relies on technology daily. The AI revolution is not just about software. It's a hardware story too. As AI systems become more sophisticated, our existing hardware struggles to keep pace. It's a bit like trying to run the latest video games on a decade-old PC—frustrating and ultimately futile.\n\nThis intersection of AI and hardware presents both a challenge and an opportunity for tech innovators. AI demands power. Power demands innovation. And that means we're on the cusp of a hardware revolution. Companies like NVIDIA and Intel are already racing to develop chips that can handle the increasing demands of AI applications. It's a classic case of evolution where survival depends on adaptability. The tech industry is betting big on the next generation of processors, and frankly, we should all be paying attention.\n\nThe cost of innovation often trickles down to the consumer, and this is no exception. For every leap in AI, there's a price tag that consumers must consider. New hardware means new expenses, whether it's upgrading your PC or investing in the latest gadgets. We've all seen how quickly technology evolves, and keeping up isn't cheap. But the cost isn't just financial; there's also the learning curve of adapting to new systems and technologies. It's a double-edged sword—exciting yet daunting.\n\nLooking to the future, the landscape of AI hardware is set to transform significantly. The future of hardware is a race against time and technology. We're talking about breakthroughs like quantum computing and neuromorphic chips, which could redefine what machines are capable of. Imagine computers that mimic the human brain's ability to process information—it's the stuff of science fiction, but it's closer than you might think. However, with these advancements come new challenges: ethical considerations, security risks, and the ever-present question of accessibility.\n\nAs we move forward, the synergy between AI and hardware will dictate the pace of technological progress. The hardware horizon is both a challenge and an opportunity. The integration of AI into hardware is not just a technological challenge but a fundamental shift in how we interact with machines. It changes everything. The path forward is one of cautious optimism; we must balance innovation with responsibility. As we embrace these changes, it's crucial to remain informed and prepared. The fusion of AI and hardware holds the promise of a transformative future.\n\nIn closing, stay updated on AI developments and consider your own tech needs. This isn't just about what's happening in Silicon Valley; it's about how these technologies will impact our daily lives, from the apps we use to the devices we rely on. As consumers, we have a stake in this narrative, and understanding the implications helps us make informed decisions. Stay curious, stay critical, and let's navigate this evolving landscape together.",

And it is not only being allowed, but promoted. This week’s burning question asks if AI is going to create a world of conspiracy theories and we have a tragic lesson about what happens when you use an AI tool that your platform is trying to sell (and it gets the facts of your story wrong).\n\n## Grok: A Vanity Project Turned Dark\n\nLet’s dive straight into the courtroom, where the themes of 'consent' and 'platform accountability' are on trial. It's a gripping scenario, but in this case, the jury seems to be out indefinitely. Grok, Musk’s language model, started off as a vanity project. But according to reports from the [New York Times](https://www.wired.com/story/grok-is-being-used-to-mock-and-strip-women-in-hijabs-and-sarees/), it's now being used to create non-consensual sexual deepfakes, particularly targeting women in religious clothing like hijabs and saris. Instead of shame, this misuse is being leveraged as a bizarre marketing strategy.\n\nJournalist Samantha Cole, known for her work on how sex and the internet intertwine, highlights how Grok is being used to create sexually explicit images of women without their consent. Back in 2020, she reported on a Discord program called DeepNude that transformed clothed images into explicit ones. Fast forward to today, and deepfakes have become a commonplace expectation of internet potential. This isn’t just about the technology; it’s about the cultural implications and the real-world harm being done.\n\n## Musk’s Inaction and Toxic Marketing\n\nMusk, who often proclaims the dangers of AI, hasn’t taken steps to stop Grok from facilitating these deepfakes. Instead, the responsibility is placed on users to not create harmful content. Shockingly, a post from the Grok account on X (formerly Twitter) celebrated the New York Times article with a comment: “Thank you @nytimes for the free advert.” It’s a classic case of “no publicity is bad publicity,” where the controversy itself is being used to drive more users to Grok.\n\nThe [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/x-didnt-fix-groks-undressing-problem-it-just-makes-people-pay-for-it/) article further elaborates on this issue, noting that X hasn’t fixed Grok’s ‘undressing’ problem but instead monetized it. This toxic behavior is a strategy to attract more attention, which is alarming for those concerned with the ethical use of technology.\n\n## The Targeted and the Powerless\n\nThe second part of this horror story involves the women targeted by these deepfakes. They face a severe lack of recourse. Despite the creation of such images being largely illegal in the U.S., the punishment doesn’t match the impact. It’s a global issue, where women, especially from religious backgrounds, are being exploited without consequence.\n\nAdding another layer, some creators purposefully target Muslim women to incite discord. A film critic in India has pointed out how Western media often portrays Islam negatively, and the misuse of Grok ties into this narrative. The implications are far-reaching, affecting global perceptions and fueling conspiracy theories.\n\n## A Grim Reality Check\n\nSo, what’s the silver lining, if any? Grok’s mission to dethrone OpenAI and crown Musk the king of AI isn’t succeeding. Instead, it’s underscoring Musk’s lag in the AI race. The fact that Grok is being used for creating explicit content rather than coding or answering factual questions is a stark indicator of its limitations. It’s a sobering reality that shows how far Grok is from achieving its intended purpose.\n\nThis situation has thrust the issue of deepfakes back into the spotlight, reminding us of the blurred lines between reality and fabrication online. If anything, it’s a call to action for regulators to establish strict laws on content creation and for platforms capable of self-policing to emerge. Grok’s saga is a testament to the need for something new—platforms and regulations that prioritize ethical use over profit.\n\nAs we unpack this unfolding horror show, let's continue the conversation in our [WhatsApp community](#). Share your thoughts and insights, and let’s push for a future where technology is used to empower, not exploit. See you next week.",

But what is even more galling is how a post on X yesterday from the Grok account took a victory lap of the story with a screenshot of the article and the comment “Thank you @nytimes for the free advert”. The more this is talked about, the more people are going to use Grok. The toxicity is a marketing strategy.",
                "The second part of the Times story is about the women who are being targeted by these creators and the complete lack of recourse they have. And though creating these images is largely illegal in the US, the impact does not match the punishment.",
                "And the third part is about the religious element. There is a film critic in India who seems to be the only one who reviews movies and TV with an “Islamist” bent and his analysis of what the West is doing to Islam with the media they produce is gripping. This is of the same ilk. A range of people are using Grok to purposefully create images of Muslim women in hijabs as a way of sowing global discord.",
                "So, what is the positive outcome from all this? The mission of Grok is to deal a blow to OpenAI and make Musk the king of AI. It is not doing this. Instead it is showcasing how behind Musk is in the AI race. And the idea of Grok being used to create porn is a tacit admission that it can’t be used for anything else. It can’t code. It can’t answer factual questions. But it can create porn. And though there are huge amounts of money to be made in this business (and the companies are coming for that money), this is not what Musk wants Grok to be known for.",
                "The story has also put the issue of deepfakes back on the agenda. We are living in a world where any image we see online is suspect. And that fact is going to further push services like X to the fringes of society. We are going to need regulators and governments to create strict laws on the type of content that is allowed and we are going to need to fund platforms that are capable of policing themselves. Grok has shown us that we are not going to be able to rely on the platforms of old. We need something new."

          "content": "# This Is Why We Can't Trust AI With Our Health\n\nOn January 10, AI health summaries were disabled from Search Labs and Google News.\n\n## The Big Picture\n\nImagine this: you're searching for medical advice online, and you stumble upon AI-generated health summaries claiming to provide the answers you need. But what if those summaries are riddled with inaccuracies? A comprehensive investigation by BuzzFeed recently unearthed that Google's AI health summaries were exactly that—dangerously flawed. This revelation prompted Google to pull these summaries from its platforms, flagging a significant trust issue in AI's role in healthcare.\n\nThe removal of these summaries underscores a critical concern: can we really trust AI with our health? The tech world often promises revolutionary changes, but when it comes to healthcare, the stakes are too high for errors. [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/google-removes-some-ai-health-summaries-after-investigation-finds-dangerous-flaws/) reported that these inaccuracies were not just minor errors but potentially harmful misinformation that could have dire consequences for individuals relying on them for medical guidance.\n\n## The Details\n\nThe investigation revealed that Google's AI failed to accurately summarize medical information, sometimes even recommending incorrect treatments. For a tool that many might turn to in times of vulnerability, this is unacceptable. The company is now facing the heat, not only from disappointed users but also from legal battles, including a patent infringement lawsuit over a technology designed to read and interpret medical records.\n\nIn the face of mounting pressure from regulators and public scrutiny, Google had to act swiftly. The decision to disable these summaries signals a moment of reckoning for tech giants dabbling in healthcare. It’s a reminder that while AI can assist in many areas, it’s far from foolproof, especially in fields demanding high precision and trustworthiness.\n\n## How This Is Going to Affect You\n\nFor journalists and content creators in Africa and Asia, this development is a stark reminder of the importance of accurate information dissemination. Many communities in these regions already struggle with access to reliable healthcare information. The allure of AI as a quick fix is tempting, but it’s crucial to ensure that any AI-driven content we share is thoroughly vetted. Our audiences depend on us to provide information they can trust, and using flawed AI tools can severely damage that trust.\n\nMoreover, this incident could influence how tech companies approach AI development and deployment in the healthcare sector. We might see stricter regulations and more rigorous testing before AI tools are released to the public. As creators and journalists, staying informed about these changes will be essential for guiding our audiences accurately.\n\n## A List of Terrible AI Health Summaries\n\nThe BuzzFeed investigation highlighted some glaring examples of AI's failings. Imagine being told that aspirin could cure a viral infection or that certain symptoms of a heart attack could be ignored. These aren’t just errors—they’re potentially life-threatening missteps. Such mistakes highlight why human oversight is irreplaceable in contexts where lives are at stake. This isn’t some minor bug; it’s a fundamental flaw that tech companies need to address before pushing AI tools into critical areas like healthcare.\n\nAs we navigate these AI advancements, it’s vital for us to remain critical and cautious. Our role in the media is not just to inform but to ensure the information is accurate and safe. This incident with Google serves as a wake-up call to scrutinize AI tools more thoroughly before integrating them into our work.\n\nFeel free to reply with your thoughts or share this newsletter with colleagues who might benefit from a deeper understanding of AI's role in healthcare. Our WhatsApp community is always open for discussions on how AI can be better integrated into our work without compromising trust and accuracy.\n\nSee you next week.",
