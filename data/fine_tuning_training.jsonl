Here are the lessons learnt from the work\nDevelop AI\nhas done this year around the world.\nMoldova & what AI is doing to podcasting\nI was in Moldova earlier this year speaking on AI and podcasting at their annual Podcast Fest and giving a workshop to a range of newsrooms from around the country on AI implementation. Thank you to\nDW Akademie\nfor making this happen. Podcasting is largely video focused in the region and AI avatars, created with platforms like\nHeyGen\n, are becoming increasingly common.\nAI lesson:\nYou can use\nCursor\nand\nElevenLabs\nto build your own AI daily podcast on all the newsletters and news you find interesting (in a language of your choice) and listen to that while making your morning coffee. Contact me for more details on how to build this.\nIn addition I also developed and conducted a cycle of\nAI and podcasting classes\nonline with Nadine Wojcik for DW Akademie. We are repeating the cycle TWICE in the new year so look out for where you can sign up.\nJudging an award at Podcast Fest in Moldova\nTanzania & dealing with how AI is killing the web\nAs part of an African retreat for International Media Support (IMS) (where I am their AI Advisor) I went to Arusha, Tanzania and presented to their African team on the changing revenue streams in media. This is being caused by the end of Google search. Newsrooms and organisations have to reckon with their traffic cratering because people are reading AI summaries now instead of visiting websites. It feels strange that we let the Internet invade our lives, we loved it, it turned horrid and now it is leaving us.\nAI lesson:\nAccept that traffic to your website is no longer the goal and redesign your work around relationships instead. What do you have that others don’t? Expertise, data and understanding of the context. And deliver this information through owned channels (email, messaging and memberships) rather than relying on platforms to send audiences to you. Don’t rely on the LLMs to send you clicks.\nArusha, Tanzania\nSouth Africa & The M20\nI spoke on a panel as part of the\nM20 Summit\nin Johannesburg on AI and came out guns blazing against big tech and the need for newsrooms to take control of their own data. The intention of the M20 initiative is to elevate issues related to media integrity, journalism and healthy information ecosystems within the official G20 policy agenda.\nYou can read the expertly written policy brief that we spoke about\nhere\n. And this is the\nG20’s response\nto the M20’s incredible work.\nI also mentored a host of South African newsrooms in AI implementation and policy creation for\nThe Thomson Reuters Foundation\n. Watch a video about that project\nhere\n.\nAnd I wrote an extensive report on AI in South African newsrooms for\nThe State of The Newsroom\n(the annual publication by The Wits Centre for Journalism). Watch the launch\nhere\n.\nDevelop AI speaking on AI and information integrity at the M20 Summit in Johannesburg\n4.\nGermany & the need to report on AI companies more critically\nIn July I was asked to participate in a Day Zero Event titled “Reclaiming our Languages: Ideation Workshop” hosted by\nDW Freedom\n, DW Akademie’s Media Development Think Tank.\nOne of the insights that emerged from the fantastic workshop which brought AI experts from around the globe together in Bonn was that journalism needs to be infinitely more critical of tech companies and their AI products, despite their proclivity to use them increasingly in their work. The analogy I tell people is you can drive a car in your city and still criticise the state of the roads. I guide newsrooms not just to use AI, but also to report on it critically in their reporting work.\nSerbia & data security\nI visited Serbia and North Macedonia last year to help newsrooms assess their AI strategies. This year I conducted a three day extensive online training for\nRadio Television of Serbia\non how they can best take their operation to the next level.\nAI lesson:\nWhen choosing if an AI tool is safe you need to do deep research. That means reading the small print. In my classes I ask participants to choose two AI tools and explore their data security (where it is stored, if you can request the logs to be deleted and if it is sold to third parties). The results can be astounding. You’ll be surprised how much you are giving up (even when you are paying for the tool) and who they are selling your data on to.\nNamibia & using AI for archiving\nWhile visiting Windhoek last month to help The Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) implement AI to their workflows I uncovered a number of pain points around how they process data and archive their broadcast material. The next stage of work with them will be to automate how they insert their metadata into everything they store. This is hardly sexy work, but it can transform how a broadcaster operates and open up extensive revenue streams for them around licensing content. If you want help with this as an organisation, get in touch.\nAI lesson:\nThe biggest gains from AI doesn’t always come from flashy tools, but from fixing invisible infrastructure. This means clean data, consistent metadata and usable archives. When this foundation is automated, AI turns legacy content into a living asset that improves operations and unlocks new revenue.\nNewsrooms in exile & AI for fundraising\nI have been working with media in exile across Central and Eastern Europe throughout this year. These outlets are facing incredible struggles with personal safety and are entirely donor funded and I have been formulating ways for AI to assist with this type of revenue stream.\nAI lesson:\nWriting a funding proposal is about correct structure and adopting the appropriate language for the donor. These are two advantages that AI can give you in spades. If you want more tips on how to build this workflow with AI, get in touch.\nAfghanistan & audience modelling\nMost recently, as the AI Advisor for International Media Support (IMS) I trained a team of journalists from SAMO (Salam Afghanistan Media Organization)\nwho are looking to implement AI more thoroughly into their newsroom. There are a host of restrictions for women and particularly their interactions with men. I workshopped with them a way to use AI to clone representatives of their audience that are hard to reach (because their voices are marginalised). And then use these AI models to solve the problems that the audience members are facing in real life.\nAI lesson:\nYou can build an AI model of your ideal customer or audience member with a custom GPT. Load it with everything you know about your audience members, give it a name and then talk to it as if they were in a focus group. You than have a constant stream of input from an AI member of the public to refer to as you make your business or editorial decisions.\nThe Copenhagen Conference on Information Integrity. 11 - 12 November 2025.\nDenmark & the need for better information integrity\nIn November I was on a panel at the\nCopenhagen Conference on Information Integrity\nwith a host of prestigious people, including Denmark’s Tech Ambassador, talking about AI and media. The need to fight disinformation and misinformation globally was at the top of our agendas.\nAI lesson:\nAI detection tools (like\nGPTZero\n) don’t work. And if you rely on them exclusively to detect the presence of AI then they can do more harm than good. I wrote more about this\nhere\n.\nThe Pacific Rim & ethics training\nI have a cherished working relationship with\nThe Public Media Alliance\nwho do work with broadcasters around the world. And we organised a series of trainings for members of The Pacific Rim. We did extensive ethics training with a host of newsrooms.\nI have developed an 8 step program on creating a bullet-proof AI ethics strategy. I presented this at\nThe African Investigative Journalism Conference\n(AIJC) in November thanks to The Thomson Reuters Foundation. And to\nAgence Française de Développement\nearlier this year.\nA huge thanks has to go to The Thomson Reuters Foundation, DW Akademie, International Media Support and Public Media Alliance for the incredible partnerships of this year. And I would like to thank the 100s of people that I have worked with around AI implementation. You have been inspiring. Here’s to 2026.\nSee you next year. Cheers.\nDevelop Al\nis an innovative consulting and training company that creates AI strategies for companies, newsrooms and individuals so they can implement AI effectively.

I was speaking at IMS’s\nCopenhagen Conference on Information Integrity\non a panel about AI and the future of media. One of my fellow panellists was the Danish Tech Ambassador, Anne Marie Engtoft Meldgaard. She was the first in the world to hold this kind of position and she had just come from the US where everyone she spoke to was obsessed with AIG (the development of a super intelligence that will replace us all). In contrast, the tone and incredible calibre of speakers at the conference (which took place at UN City) made me feel like the EU is focused on the moral and humane use of tech in the world and how we can harness it for good.\nThis was true for the delegates in that room, but meanwhile, this month, the long established EU AI Act\nhas been put under strain\n. (I wrote about the Act’s details\nhere\n). It was adopted by the EU and entered into force on 1 August 2024. But many key obligations didn’t apply immediately, particularly for the “high-risk” systems which includes everything from healthcare to certain toys.\nImportant parts of its mandate may be postponed or discarded allegedly in an attempt to woo the very tech companies that we all spent the week at the conference lambasting. The Commission denies being influenced by such companies.\nHere is what is potentially changing with the AI Act:\nThe EU is preparing to present a “digital omnibus” reform package (scheduled for today, the 19th of November 2025) which will include targeted amendments to the AI Act and other digital-legislation.\nThese potential amendments are framed around simplification: the idea that the regulatory burden might be too heavy or too complex, especially for smaller players or certain sectors. BUT there are rumours that the Commission is considering giving a one-year “grace period” for high-risk or generative AI systems already on the market. One year in AI is like ten or a hundred regular years.\nIt be fair, the technical standards to implement most of the Act’s provisions are not yet finalised. And, of course, very few people building AI products want this to happen. It isn’t just Meta and Musk, the guy who got laid off last year and is now vibe-coding his heart out also doesn’t want a range of hurdles to stop his million dollar app getting to market.\nWhy this all matters\nThe Act is partially intended to build public trust in AI by showing governments are acting. Delays can signal weakness or capture by industry. That erodes the legitimacy of the regulation and may reduce public acceptance of AI systems in the long run.\nIf harmful incidents occur during the “delay window,” the absence of regulation could lead to an old fashioned backlash.\nWhat is the flip side?\nSome argue that rushing regulation can be harmful. It may over-regulate, stifle innovation, mis-classify technologies or become quickly outdated given how fast AI evolves.\nDelaying the AI Act\nmay not necessarily\nfix its problems. The regulation’s architecture is already showing strain: the original sector-based risk logic collapsed in the face of general-purpose models like ChatGPT, forcing the EU to add a capabilities-based layer. Revision of the Act is largely limited to annual reviews which are slow and subject to politics.\nI’ll be covering this slow (yet rather interesting) story in future letters.\nThe AI tool of the week that you can use\nA while back\nI wrote about\ndownloading your own LLM and running it on your laptop. Now, you can do it with far greater ease. By using\nOllama\nyou can load a host of LLMs directly onto your computer. This means you can have an AI to use that isn’t connected to the Internet for “sensitive” tasks. Even though these models are inferior to the likes of ChatGPT 5.1 they are, of course, free.\nAI & Work: how is your job going to change?\nTwo months ago, Stephen Bartlett (who occupies the smarmiest corner of Dragon’s Den) managed to pause from creating clickbait for medicine that doesn’t work for two seconds to do a\ncompetent interview\nabout the future of work in the age of AI.\nI have\ntalked plenty\n(for years) about how the web will be decimated because of AI, but what is talked about less is the type of person who will work in media is going to change if news continues to personalise and the content we consume is written by AI rather than a human.\nThe job of a journalist is ostensibly pious, but is also propped up by a tremendous need for recognition. Awards ceremonies fuel the industry (I have been to plenty and even though journalists want societal impact, they also want to see their name on those bylines and statues). With start-ups like\nScroll\nin India we are about to enter an era where journalists write their stories, submit them to an editor for checking but they are then processed and the audience members never see a word of what was written. They will receive their content in the tone, language or format that they prefer. Maybe as a podcast or a series of tweets, but no content that the journalist actually produced. And if you remove that ego aspect that will mean different types of people will enter the profession. Not necessarily worse people to do the job of investigating, but certainly different. And this is going to be true for all jobs, as skills need to change so will the intangible benefits. Think of an animator working on a huge Marvel film and being a name among hundreds at the end of a movie. Most journalists (myself included when I was working on investigations) wouldn’t cope with that. The transition period with AI has always been pitched as one around skills, but it is also going to be social and personal.\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nLast month I was in Chișinău, Moldova (which is a city that pops with energy and is the only place I’ve visited that is cheaper than South Africa) giving a full workshop on how AI is shaping the newsroom to a host of very engaged journalists. I was also talking at Moldova’s\nPodcast Fest\npresenting a 90 minute Masterclass on AI and Podcasting and how the tech is shaping the business of audio and video. Thanks to\nDW Akademie\n,\nThe Moldova School of Journalism\nand Olena Ponomarenko for the amazing support and partnerships. It has been really great working with everyone.\nTwo weeks ago I was on home turf at\nThe African Investigative Journalism Conference\nin Johannesburg giving a workshop with Caroline James on how AI can ethically complement investigative journalism. Thanks to the\nThomson Reuters Foundation\nand the fantastic work they are doing in this space.\nI have been consulting with\nJust Detention International\non how to create an ethical AI policy for their staff and output. It feels like every organisation needs to go through this process and great results can come for those who do it sooner rather than later.\nSee you next week.

You input prompts and their\nVeo 3\nmodel generates 10 second video clips. It also lets you juggle the 10 second clips around like you are “making a movie”. But in reality you still need to export any work into Adobe Premiere to do a final edit (this is similar to\nDescript\nfor audio editing: useful to startt an edit but the full control you need to do a final polish is largely absent from AI tools).\nAI video of Will Smith eating spaghetti from April 2023\n(video generated using Stable Diffusion and voices generated with Elevenlabs)\nBelow you can see a quick series of clips I created using Flow from a TV pilot (never produced) that I wrote last year. People talking on phones: looks good. The sweat on a man’s forehead: looks terrible. I had to remove several clips because characters from one clip to the next were wearing different clothes, but I was incredibly impressed with the use of audio and speech.\nThe truth is generating full length video with Veo 3 is too expensive for a hobbyist and not professional enough for real production. With an API call it works out (according to Google) at 0.75USD a second. The clip I created above was from a bunch of free credits they gave me to whet my appetite. We are in an awkward financial uncanny valley. And because of the cost you find yourself using clips that are passable, but not necessarily what you demanded. The game going forward will be to try and bring those costs way down through millions of tricks and gradually wait for the models to get cheaper. Though,\nWill Smith eating spaghetti\nis now 2 years ago and with the quality ramp up we have seen you’d think it was 10.\nA version of this story first appeared on my LinkedIn newsletter,\nDevelop AI Daily\n.\nIs AI coding losing its value? Here's what you need to know\nIt breaks my heart a little that one of my favourite things to do has now been given the hideous term \"vibe coding\". This is where you use AI to help you code an app. I am not a coder, but I was a pretty early adopter of vibe coding. Back in the Summer (in the southern hemisphere) of 2022 I would ask ChatGPT for code to copy and paste into\nColab\n(Google's platform where you can run Python code as easily as a Google Doc). Those feel like simple times now, because with apps like\nCursor\nand Claude's capacity for coding it feels like we are now further removed from the process. You prompt Cursor and it rattles off code and theories of what it plans to do next and I find myself checking my emails while I wait for it to finish. And then when I return to the code I am a little lost and disengaged.\nThis may be why there has been a backlash (as there is with all things). New\nresearch\nshows developers think AI makes them 20% faster but in reality they are 19% slower. And a good friend of mine (who has a degree in Artificial Intelligence) sees this eventually causing a global problem where the world's codebase becomes so inefficient and poorly written that it all comes tumbling down. I guess, in my own small way, I am contributing to this downfall. But, I am slowly becoming less convinced of the vibe coding hype, because since the acceleration of these platforms to \"help\" people like me code, my output of apps that actually work has decreased.\nIn those days of 2022 and early 2023 you had to plot out each step of your app (I was initially building an app that could create synthetic podcasts) and ask for code for each step of the process so you didn't get tangled in error messages. The promise is greater now, but it is hollow. Like so much AI use, attribute 40% to hype, use the tool, but still expect to do at least half the work (while you are being promised a world where you do nothing). And there is a weird \"AI resentment barrier\" that you need to struggle through. Instead of being grateful for the help, you resent that you have been lied to and have to do anything. That is the stage of AI development we are in, a resentment gully, but if you pull yourself out of that you can still reap the rewards.\nIn the news\nMeta is facing\nfresh backlash\nfor letting their AI bots hold “sensual” chats with teenagers. Feels damning that they considered this issue and then let it pass, according to the reporting. But they know their competitor in this space is\ncharacter.ai\nwhere you can talk to your own character (or millions of others) about anything and be as “sensual” as you want.\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nI recently wrote an extensive report on AI in South African newsrooms for The State of The Newsroom (the annual publication by\nThe Wits Centre for Journalism\n).\nLater this week I’ll be helping to conduct the closing off workshop for\nThomson Reuters Foundation\nfor their South African cohort of newsrooms. I have been coaching them to produce AI prototypes and AI ethical policies.\nSee you next week.

It categorises AI systems as being either “unacceptable”, “high”, “limited” or “minimal” risk. Those under scrutiny as \"unacceptable\" are AI systems used for social scoring, real-time facial recognition in public and manipulative systems that prey on the vulnerable. If your model distorts behaviour and causes harm, it’s banned. Fair enough.\nCreated with ChatGPT\nBut also, what they consider \"high risk\" are AI tools used in education, healthcare, policing, employment, migration and justice, with the argument that the stakes are human rights. However, these are also areas where AI can provide incredible benefit. Providers must comply with strict rules, hand over technical documentation, endure human oversight, testing and transparency. If your model evaluates job applicants, allocates school placements or assists in a criminal trial, then you are going to need to put in the work. I am for this in theory, we have already seen rampant bias and racism in areas like recruitment, but arguably the red tape could stop plenty of innovations even happening.\nImportantly, you can’t dodge responsibility just because your company’s based in Nairobi or New York. If your AI’s output affects anyone in the EU then you can be accountable. But then it makes me think could I just turn off my app for people in the EU? If they don’t want me then I don’t want them…\nI’ve said before that the AI Act is grossly pro government: go back to that face recognition rule, it stops security companies from developing systems but allows the police to create their own. If you move this to an African context, where services are increasingly privatised, it’s ludicrous. This will simply pool the high end tech in the governments and institutions that need the most oversight.\nSo, what does it mean for OpenAI, Meta and Google? These are foundation models trained on enormous datasets, capable of powering thousands of downstream apps. Well, there is a ticking clock: AI models already on the market before August 2nd, 2025 (just the other day) have until August 2nd, 2027 to ensure compliance. And August 2nd, 2026 is when most remaining provisions will become enforceable.\nThe big LLMs will need to disclose their training data, comply with copyright law, and publish how their models work. This is great news. And most companies have voluntarily signed a code of practice to show goodwill… except Meta and Apple. People are speculating that the lack of signing may be “legal limbo” or quite the opposite.\nI would strongly recommend\nLuiza's Newsletter\nfor AI legal updates.\nIf you are enjoying what you’re reading please consider paying $5 a month to\nhelp support\nthis newsletter.\nPay $5 to support this newsletter\nOne journalist thought it was a good idea to interview an AI avatar of a dead teenager\nResident ex-CNN blowhard Jim Acosta probably imagined he would get plenty of subscribers for\nhis YouTube channel\nearlier this week. Unfortunately, a google search of \"Jim Acosta youtube\" brings his channel up in 7th place under half a dozen outraged articles and videos ABOUT what he did rather than his actual video.\nJoaquin Oliver, who died at age 17 in the\nParkland school shooting\nin 2018 was\ninterviewed\nby Acosta on Tuesday with the \"magic\" of AI and the endorsement of the kid/now adult’s father, Manuel.\nThe tasteless outrage is obvious. And the counter of it being to raise awareness for gun control in the US is maybe more so. But, what should be stressed is the AI implementation is bad. Truly horrendous. It isn’t clear if he is interacting with the avatar in real time or if everything is scripted and pre-prepared. Either way it is stunted. The voice is robotic and the avatar without expression. And for this to be a flashpoint for people to get a display of what AI cloning can offer, even with off-the-shelf apps, in 2025 is disingenuous.\nAnd the larger point is what this means for the ecosystem of washed up TV news anchors. For Acosta to do this for 36k views on YouTube (after three days) with the tag \"Don't give in to the lies. Don't give up on the truth\" seems to say, 1) even with global publicity there is no guarantee that people will visit your actual channel or content and 2) we are now increasingly being forced to consume media that isn't created by a team, but just one guy in his house. This post you are reading is the same, written by just me in my home office, without a sub or an editor in sight.\nAnd this solo creation by design means the quality of the journalism is going to be compromised, even if the freedom is greater (the conspiracy is that Acosta was ousted from CNN for being against Trump) and the stunts more daring, the product is going to be diminished. I am pro Substack (naturally) but we have to acknowledge that the biggest effect of technology on news isn't AI avatars, but that we now want deep personalisation. And this isn't yet \"liquid content\" where we will get articles or podcasts produced by AI specifically for us, but singular voices (like Joe Rogan or Piers Morgan or Trevor Noah) who will cozy up to us and tell us exactly what they think. The problem is, these guys don't have checks or balances or press codes to hinder them. And even though Acosta seems to be terrible at it, this style of news is winning our attention and that means we a destined for just more noise and less substance.\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nI am honoured to be talking at the\nM20 Summit\nat the start of September on a panel about the significance of AI in journalism. The M20 is an initiative to amplify media, journalism and information integrity issues relevant to the G20.\nI’ll also be presenting at a UNESCO conference (remotely, for their office in Bangkok) on the topic of “AI-Driven Newsrooms and Journalism Education” towards the end of August.\nSee you next week.

The software used for AI detection at universities is an example of this. We want to know if the kids are using ChatGPT to write their essays! The university where I went (UCT)\njust discontinued using their AI detection\nsoftware\nTurnitin\nin disgrace. I would be heartily skeptical of sending my kids there (or any university that uses it or\nGPTZero\nor any one of these packages) given the overwhelming evidence that none of these packages work. They are easily tricked or condemn work as AI generated when it isn't. I met a father in North Macedonia last year who was involved in a battle with his daughter's college over a AI dispute that was threatening to get her expelled. And it is evident that tertiary institutions don't know what to do.\nCreated with ChatGPT\nThe solution I have been touting is simple and I think effective: build an LLM for your campus, tailor it specifically with the books and materials that your students need and allow them to use it as much as they want. You will have the capacity to monitor all their chats and AI generations on the backend and you will be able to analyse and score the quality of their interactions with the chatbot and even put that towards their mark. Though, the rule is they can only use the designated LLM and if they stray they are penalised. And here comes the tricky part... we need to reinvent what we ask our students that actually tests them in this new world order. What is a useful skill if all written content in a person's future job is to be AI generated? The often touted secret sauce of a university education is \"critical thinking\", well, what does that look like when AI becomes competent at thinking for us? The universities across the globe need to grapple with this, instead of scratching in the mud for ineffective ways to catch out their students.\nI am busy building these private LLMs for certain organisations and believe universities in Africa need them immediately.

Yesterday Google launched\na significant new feature\nto my most loved AI tool. Ostensibly for \"research\",\nNotebookLM\nallows you to upload a \"notebook\" of PDFs and links and then chat to them so you can understand a subject better. Last year they snuck in a way to turn your dry PDFs into an annoying, zany American style chat podcast. They have since allowed you to have those podcast hosts chat in dozens of different languages and now they are adding a video option, so you can create your own YouTube video on the subject of your choice. NotebookLM is already an app I use to absorb a bunch of complicated documents in a short space of time (via 20 minutes of audio rather than read 100s of pages), but the use case is becoming compelling for me to quickly create my morning news with the service and gobble it up as an audience of one. It is the ultimate echo chamber, where I will only bump up against the bias inherent in Google's Gemini (the LLM that is writing the scripts from the uploaded info). And for media organisations they can't contest not being credited because it is never strictly \"published\" outside of my own private use. But when you duplicate that private use millions of times where does that leave the creators of the \"source material\"?\nAI website crawling is\nhaving a bit of a moment\n. The crawlers that companies like OpenAI use to land grab the world's data don't play as nice as we hoped. But the self-created content future of NotebookLM (and whatever comes after) weirdly makes this issue obsolete: each user will spend a couple of minutes copying, pasting, exporting websites into PDFs and grabbing the transcripts of podcasts and then serving them right into Google's mouth. They will then spend the next hour consuming their morning content with no adverts and without a cent passing into the hands of a journalist.\nThe only thing that can stop this future is if the users (me and you) resist the temptation and content creators are going to need to build a pretty compelling case for us to do that. Their stuff needs to be better than what we can make ourselves... and they don't even know us.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nNone, besides the image.\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nI use AI strategies to work with\nIMS (International Media Support)\n,\nThomson Reuters Foundation\n,\nDW Akademie\n,\nPublic Media Alliance\nand others to improve the impact of media globally.

Even when the “facts” were correct what underpinned a lot of media literacy was the idea that as soon as you become Media Literate then you will believe X, Y and Z. And people sensed this agenda and rejected it. Brexit and Trump were obvious examples of media organisations believing that if the public understood Critical Thinking and all the rest then the LOGICAL step would be to not vote for Brexit or not vote for Trump or think a certain way about COVID. And people immediately saw the smug, elite attitude behind that. You can be Media Literate and \"informed on the issues\" and still have voted for Brexit (even if I don’t personally agree with voting for it). You can't have a political agenda of what you want a person to believe if you are sincerely trying to teach them to be critical on their own terms.\nCreated using using ChatGPT\nSo, media literacy became a skills game. Similar to fact-checking with teaching people the classic \"reverse image search\" to spot where an image originated. And we largely disregarded the psychological and behavioural aspects of how misinformation and propaganda works. And if we are going to double down on trying to teach the world to assess the media better (rather than fighting and debunking ever piece of content) in the age of AI then we need to be clear with what we want our media literacy training to lead to and it probably shouldn’t be as pre-determined as before. For example, if all roads to this new education have to lead to the students hating the tech companies (which personally I would probably design at the moment seeing how much I hate them) then we would see a similar rejection of the skills of analysis and critical thinking that would be useful for them.\nWhen I was at\nThe Global Media Forum\nin Bonn earlier this month I attended a session hosted by an organisation called\nLie Detectors\n. They run a system of sending journalists into schools in Austria, Germany and other EU countries to teach kids how to understand and fact-check their social media feeds. It is an inspired idea, though they are working with particularly young kids before they become too hardened. And there is a soft power element as mainstream journalists punt their undercover influencers (funded by their media outlets) to kids in a hope that they will follow them and absorb better content and ultimately become customers of their adult news when they are old enough.\nThis is your brain... on AI\nIf you are old enough to remember the absurd 80s adverts from the US of “\nthis is your brain… this is your brain on drugs\n” where men talked sternly to the camera and illustrated your drug-addled fate by menacingly cracking an egg and frying it - that was your BRAIN being fried - will wonder when we are going to get similar PSAs for AI. There was a big splash when\nMIT released a study\nin June saying that if you use an LLM then your brain is under-engaged compared to even using a search engine and that there should be concern about what this would do to “long-term educational implications of LLM reliance”. But I would posit that this is a result of nascent AI use where we are all still sitting and waiting for AI results and doing the same tasks as two years ago but with AI “help”. This phase will be short-lived and I think the hardest part of the AI jobapocalypse is going to be people will steadily use less brain engagement to do the same work, feel steadily more guilty for it, until they are fired. And really employers (with AI training and coaching) need to start recalibrating jobs now so they can keep their staff engaged and useful.\nThe real kicker is this article from\nHarvard Business Review\n(quoting a study from the\nJournal of Marketing\n) which found that those people who study and know more about AI are not necessarily going to be the ones who embrace it. However, those who knew less about AI saw it as less capable and less ethical (than those who knew more), but were struck by the “magic” of its abilities and this fuelled their enthusiasm.\nIf you are enjoying what you’re reading please consider paying $5 a month to\nhelp support\nthis newsletter.\nPay $5 to support this newsletter\nAfrica, AI and the M20\nSo, a group of researchers and journalists (some of them friends of mine) are\npulling together the M20\nwhich will ride along side\nthe G20\nin Johannesburg in November and address the media’s “relevance”. You have all the powerful people in one room and it feels pertinent for them to consider the state of the media. Though, it feels crazy to talk about “the media” as one entity that has a cohesive perspective or agenda in 2025, but in modern times we also like a team up and it is true that journalists need to cover the horrific developments of AI while actually adopting AI methods and tools to improve their output.\nThe M20 want to address how the power is concentrated in a few tech companies, how Africans have been paid excruciatingly low salaries to label images and help big tech companies build their billions and also, most interestingly, they want to address how journalists have reported on AI poorly. They want to address the “knowledge gaps” in journalism and stop every tech story being PR fluff. This issue came up when I was part of the\nDW Freedom: The Media Development Think Tank\nworkshop on AI earlier this month at\nThe Global Media Forum\nin Bonn. It was a honour to be part of that group and I’ll be writing more about the work of DW Freedom. Though, I will say, journalists besmirching big companies and then turning them into enemies shouldn’t really be something they need help with.\nThe meat of the M20 proposal is around journalism safety, repression of freedom and combating the use of AI for large-scale information manipulation. We all need assistance with these issues and this has to be stressed at a regulatory level. Also, the need for more African languages to be incorporated into the AI ecosystem is crucial.\nIMS (International Media Support)\nare deep in bringing together media partners, universities and technologists to try and solve the AI African language problem. Figuring out how to get it paid for and not be completely controlled by the big tech companies is a huge challenge. I’ll be covering more of the M20 as it rolls around.\nMy Faith Is Fading\nLast week saw the scales starting to fall from the eyes of the AI Hype Cycle.\nPolitico\n, the shining star of AI newsroom product development (I wrote about how they rolled out exciting AI products to their readers for a premium price so readers could do their jobs more efficiently) shows\nthe behaviour\nthat every journalist fears when the so called \"business side\" gets hold of the content. Turns out they have been releasing AI products that don’t work (inaccurate a large amount of the time) and undermine the journalism in the process. Meanwhile, 404\nwrote a scathing article\nabout the difficulty of stopping LLMs from scraping their website and argued that to position your media company as “AI First” is a buzzword that won’t save your business. This is because the tech companies aren’t interested in your “media” company longterm. They are actively trying to scrape paywalled content globally, right now.\nDigital Digging tested AI systems\nin June 2025 across a host of\npublications\nusing established open-source intelligence methodologies. The results showed OpenAI's ChatGPT, Perplexity, and xAI's Grok successfully accessed protected content approximately 50% of the time, while Anthropic's Claude achieved 35% and Google's Gemini proved the least aggressive.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nNone, besides the image.\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nI am busy developing AI strategies for newsrooms in exile for the\nThomson Reuters Foundation\n.

There was no way they could disclose that they were using AI to their audience, because they were convinced that their audience would consider them too “lazy” if they discovered AI was being used. And regardless of the accuracy or their enjoyment of the content, he was convinced members of the audience would definitely turn away from the outlet if AI was involved.\nCreated with Meta AI\nThis has struck me as a vital note in the AI insanity of the last few years. Media organisations have become largely brainwashed by large donors and impact investors to prioritise “membership models” and “audience engagement” as the road to revenue. And though there are success stories of membership models making money, by design it can only work for the top few. The rest are left berating themselves and agonising over their newsletter open rates. So, the idea of AI shattering this close human connection between the writer and the content is understandably distressing. But the truth is, AI is reshaping journalism and the audience doesn’t know what they are going to be upset or enthralled by until they see it.\nIdeally, we need to acknowledge where AI is involved in the reporting process and be honest with audiences about what that means. This is usually solved by thoroughly talking to an audience and meeting them halfway: they may be okay with certain tasks being AI augmented, like data analysis, but they still want stuttering human voices on a podcast (for example).\nHere are five ways AI could support public service journalism and how each could also cause harm if we forget what the point of journalism is in the first place:\n1. Automating the boring stuff\nThe positive:\nAI can free up journalists to focus on original reporting, investigations, and community engagement.\nTool example:\nNotta\nprovides AI-based voice-to-text transcription supporting over 100 languages, facilitating multilingual content creation.\nThe negative:\nIf media organisations start to rely on AI to create journalism instead of supporting it, you end up with filler content, articles with no soul, no context, and no public value. Public interest takes a back seat to “content velocity.”\n2. Reaching new audiences\nThe positive:\nAI-driven personalisation can help newsrooms tailor stories to different languages, regions, or even individual readers. This could be transformative in multilingual societies where access to news in your own language isn’t guaranteed. It’s also an opportunity to reach younger audiences on the platforms they actually use.\nTool example:\nAdobe Target\nhelps with personalised content delivery based on user behaviour, enhancing reader engagement.\nThe negative:\nHyper-personalisation also creates filter bubbles. If every user gets a version of the news tailored to their preferences, we lose shared narratives. Worse, editorial priorities can shift away from what’s important to what’s clickable for each audience segment.\n3. Investigating at scale\nThe positive:\nAI can analyse massive datasets, such as leaked documents, financial records, social media networks, to spot corruption, disinformation, or environmental abuse. These are tools that empower small teams to punch way above their weight.\nTool example:\nBellingcat’s Online Investigations Toolkit\ngives a unique set of tools including geolocation and social media analysis.\nThe negative:\nInvestigative work that leans too heavily on AI can become detached from human context. Worse, they could flag the wrong patterns, sending journalists down rabbit holes that waste time or mislead. And if the source of your insights is a black-box model with unclear logic, how do you defend your reporting?\n4. Fighting misinformation and disinformation\nThe positive:\nAI tools can identify coordinated disinformation campaigns, and trace the spread of viral lies. That’s huge. It arms journalists and the public alike with defenses against bad actors trying to pollute the information ecosystem.\nTool example:\nMeedan’s Check\nis a fantastic service where you can build a tip line for your community and analyse the results.\nThe negative:\nAutomated content moderation often fails to understand irony, dissent, or cultural context. Legitimate voices, especially from marginalised communities, can be suppressed by blunt AI filters trained on the biases of the dominant web.\n5. Enhancing legal and ethical oversight\nThe positive:\nAI is being used by journalists and editors to identify potential legal and ethical issues. This includes detecting defamatory statements and ensuring compliance with privacy laws.\nTool example:\nHarvey.ai\nis a legal AI assistant. I assume the name is a reference to Suits.\nThe negative:\nThese tools may not fully grasp context or nuanced legal standards, potentially leading to oversight of critical issues.\nThe big threat\nOne of the biggest threats to freedom of the press today isn’t an oppressive government or a corrupt billionaire, it is that trust in all information has been shattered. If the public can’t trust anything they see, then it is hard for legitimate media to convince them otherwise. We’re already seeing AI-created deepfakes used to discredit reporters and attack their credibility online (there was a\nfascinating piece\non this in The Daily Maverick). It gets worse when you consider AI-powered facial recognition and metadata analysis can be used to track journalists, monitor their communications and expose their sources. In some parts of the world, this kind of technology has been used to intimidate and silence critical voices.\nAn AI model doesn’t care whether it’s helping you investigate corruption or making up a plausible sounding conspiracy theory. It just does what it’s trained to do: predict the next word. This recent podcast episode highlights very well how we shouldn’t\noveruse the technology\n.\nI have been told that Meta plans to give preferential treatment on Facebook to posts created with Meta AI (rather than just ones you write yourself or create with other AI models), so be prepared to go to war with the platforms in getting your content seen in the coming months.\nHowever, the ethical guardrails around AI needs to be “sold” to newsrooms as a necessity, really as the only way they are going to stand above every YouTuber and TikToker in the land. If they get down in the mud with the rest of the content creators it is unlikely that they’ll win.\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nI have recently been in Tanzania at the Africa retreat for International Media Support (IMS). I was presenting on “AI and New Opportunities For Public Interest Journalism”. They are all incredibly smart, lovely people.\nI am honoured to have been invited to attend a workshop called “Reclaiming Our Languages” in Germany in July, hosted by Deutsche Welle (as part of The Media Development Think Tank). It is a way for experts in the field from across the world to trade concepts on how to develop more linguistic diversity in AI applications.\nFor the formidable\nThomson Reuters Foundation\nI am guiding several newsrooms from across South Africa to build AI products for their newsrooms and create robust AI policies. I will keep you posted on what they create.\nI will be doing an online training in June for Public Media Alliance entitled “Responsible AI For Pacific Public Media” which I am really looking forward to.\nI have been asked to contribute towards the highly revered\nState of The Newsroom\n, published each year by the Wits Centre for Journalism. I’ll be writing about the state of AI and media in South Africa.\nSee you next week.

I use ChatGPT.” But that has begun to change. I still use ChatGPT for help, but I am getting a tighter grip every day on how software is built and what it is capable of.\nThis week I upped my tech skills and downloaded\nmy own AI model\n. I opted for American. Thanks Zuck. And I loaded it on a PC in my lounge (a machine that is traditionally used for storing and\nplaying 90s movies\n).\nThe first step was to download the latest Llama model (that’s Meta’s version of ChatGPT). You can use Zuck’s AI on the\nweb\nand even (in certain countries) straight through WhatsApp. However, on a dedicated PC in my house I have loaded a considerably trimmed down version. To put it in perspective, I am running Llama 3.2 1B (this has 1 billion parameters while the full model has 90 billion). This means that as an AI it struggles to do much more than basic text, but the data stays entirely in my house. I don’t yet have the hardware capacity to go all in.\nCreated with ChatGPT\nThe key to doing this is I want\nMediaMap\n(our app that is mapping the world media’s implementation of AI) to not constantly call the OpenAI API to generate insights and chat responses, because every time it does I have to throw Sam Altman a few coins. My plan is for MediaMap to call the Llama model in my home. Of course, at the moment this model of Llama operates like a broken version of ChatGPT, but you have to start somewhere. And this brings us to the necessary hardware…\nThere are electricity costs (and loadshedding concerns), but the big expense is the hardware. You are looking at thousands of USD for a system that can run a large version of Llama (with the sweet 90 billion parameters rather than the 1 billion I have now) and run it at a speed which is tolerable. So, I am going to need to upgrade the hardware. But then I’ll have a functional LLM that I can “speak” to (and so can anyone else using MediaMap) with theoretically no ongoing cost.\nAnd then the next step will be to “fine-tune” the model for specific tasks. There are a host of libraries on\nHugging Face\nand I am imagining this set-up being perfect for our\nJustice AI\nproject that is designed to help journalists choose legal cases that can deliver impactful stories more effectively.\nAfter China dropped the\nDeepSeek\nbomb last week, Open Source AI has edged closer to being the norm. I\nwrote about\nMeta’s move towards Open Source early last year and it still seems like their strategy is to give away Llama in order to stay relevant and encourage developers to work within the Meta ecosystem. It’s\nassumed\nthe larger play is to have the world using Llama and then increase user engagement with Meta’s platforms (though I have felt no pressure to use more Facebook or Instagram during my own operation).\nI will keep you updated on how this develops (and to what extent the electricity bill balloons).\nThis week’s AI tool to use…\nI have been deep in the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) mines. The data that is publicly available and the ways you can analyse it with AI is truly outstanding. I’ll be writing about how we can all become mini-investigators in an upcoming letter. I honestly believe crowd encouraged investigating could be the future of media in general, but that’s another story.\nIn the meantime, a few fun tools have leapt out at me (though be warned, even though these tools use publicly available data, a few are proprietary, so not Open Source, and could lock you into a pricing plan). For example, a tool like\nHunchly\ncaptures all the websites you visit and documents them so all that juicy research is saved and easily retrievable. And\nShodan\nfeels futuristic and frightening as it allows you to search for anything connected to the Internet from power plants to refrigerators to open servers (and helps you secure your own Internet enabled objects).\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nI have an unhealthy obsession with AI product subscriptions. They are “for work” but like any addiction, they need to be managed. In that spirit, I cancelled\nMidjourney\nlast week and I am passing this hardship on to you, the reader, because it means the images on this newsletter will now be created with ChatGPT. Sorry.\nIf you are enjoying what you’re reading please consider paying $5 a month to\nhelp support\nthis newsletter.\nPay $5 to support this newsletter\nIn the news\nThe BBC published\nthis report\nabout the inaccuracies of AI models this week. And on its face this report makes sense: LLMs are not reliable for truthful information. They tested ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Perplexity. The report says: 51% of all AI answers to questions about the news had issues. 19% of AI answers which cited BBC content created factual errors. And 13% of the quotes sourced from BBC articles were either altered or made up. I\nwrote the other week about\nhow you don’t need to even use an LLM to get BBC misinformation, now your phone can add errors to their news directly. I imagine the BBC would love it if you just went directly to their app or website, but I would like to know how these stats compare to the accuracy of an average Google search or Wikipedia page.\nThe\nDeepSeek\nChina AI hyper cycle seems to have slowed, for now. Of course, OpenAI was upset and it was delicious when a company that has built its premium product by stealing the images, audio, text and video created by others then\nstarts to moan\nabout another company stealing from them.\nBurn of the week\n: everyone’s rich dad Elon Musk offered robot face Sam Altman $97.4 billion for OpenAI. And Altman\nhit back\n(on Musk’s own platform) with, “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want”.\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nI am training journalists from all around Africa in AI, starting this Thursday. Our course is online and for six weeks. My co-trainer is the formidable Peter Deselaers.

It felt like this evolution in search would solve all of my life’s problems. But now, decades later, I just feel like I am drowning in Zoom call recordings and endless WhatsApp group images. The most exciting part of the AI revolution, for me, is that we will finally have order and insights from all this data we have been collecting.\nWhen it comes to training news organisations in how to use AI, I have seen a huge gap in using AI technology to document their AI journeys and produce insights based on their data for how they can do better. We needed a platform which could map the AI adoption of newsrooms globally and this platform is now a reality. We have created it at Develop AI and it is called MediaMap.\nCreated with ChatGPT\nAt the heart of MediaMap is a chat interface where you talk to an AI assistant about your media business. MediaMap will ask you questions and try to get to the bottom of how you are using AI in your newsroom. There is also the opportunity to upload documents and scrape websites.\nMediaMap’s chat interface\nThe platform then takes all this information about your organisation and runs it through ChatGPT with an added knowledge base and expert prompting to track important metrics on how your business is dealing with AI.\nSidebar for the MediaMap platform\nAnd when you have given the platform enough information you can trigger it to generate insights for how you should improve your business going forward. It will advise you on what goals to prioritise and why. The more you chat to MediaMap then the better its insights.\nThere is also a heavy Admin section inside MediaMap where Develop AI can see the chats, inputs and feedback from all the different users. This, in turn, will help improve the platform and allow us to build better, more targeted AI courses.\nA cute addition is that we have added a world map tab so organisations can insert themselves onto the map and also see where other organisations in the network are based. Because truly, the goal of the project is mapping the media’s AI adoption and proficiency, but also to act as an AI knowledge sharing platform across multiple continents.\nMediaMap is in Beta. Let me know if you are a news organisation that would be happy to use it and give helpful feedback so we can create the best experience possible.\nHow to code with AI\nOur MediaMap project has tied neatly into my fascination with the no-code phenomenon which is naturally enticing but whiffs of snake oil. So, for the MediaMap project I thought it would be worth trying it with a selection of no-code platforms. After reading plenty of reviews I arrived at\nBolt\nand the initial pitch is ridiculous: you can write a prompt and it will build you an app.\nFirst, the bad: by working the chatbot hard for an afternoon I fully burned through my $20 of credits allocated to me for the month. The cash ran out just as the app completely filled with errors and crashed forcing me to “top-up” with extra credits. Next, pinpointing an error is easy, but fixing it economically in a no-code environment is similar to asking ChatGPT to make a very specific change to an image. It’s very tough to get the exact response that you want. You give a prompt to fix an error and it regenerates a whole section of code from scratch, fixing the error perhaps, but then deleting a different feature that you were perfectly happy with. This combined with the financial limits laid out in talking to the bot can result in a pretty frustrating experience.\nThe exciting part is as you click on your new app’s buttons, the bot finds faults and politely informs you how they are being fixed. This makes you feel like you are in the future. However, you may never come to the end of the faults that need to be fixed…\nSecond, the good: it truly is remarkable how you can, in a few hours, knock together a prototype. I would say 50% of the features won’t fully work, but the general feel will be conveyed. On the app’s design: it can be crisp and professional, however, you can’t be overly fussy. Asking to move a logo or button an inch to the left can destroy a whole sidebar in the process. You are not encouraged to look at the code, though it is accessible on a separate tab as it is being written by AI at lightening speed.\nWhen my patience was reached and I sensed more dollars would be needed to fix all the faults, I exported my code into\nCursor\n(which I have raved about continuously in this newsletter). This platform is “AI Code” rather than “no-code” and by comparison feels deeply technical. This is where you have a chatbot that you ask for snippets of code and you export them into your master codebase, chunk by chunk. With Cursor you pay a subscription, but chatting with the bot is unlimited.\nWhen using Cursor you need to have a better idea of what code and apps can do, and using it can gradually teach you the basics of coding by osmosis, while platforms like Bolt are encouraging you to think BIG and learn nothing, like you are an ad exec from the 80s.\nMy verdict on no-code is: in another year this could be incredible. You can throw up your basic idea with these platforms in a way that is magical, but getting the app functional without diving into the code (they gracefully offer editing as “free”) is impossible.\nFor MediaMap, once I got it into Cursor and downloaded a bunch of necessary Python packages I could fire the app up in Chrome and start to dig into the errors in a more methodical way. This hybrid option is still the route to go for coding with AI in 2025.\nIf you would like more info on MediaMap and its potential, get in touch.\nIf you are enjoying what you’re reading please consider paying $5 a month to\nhelp support\nthis newsletter.\nPay $5 to support this newsletter\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nThe main image was lovingly created with ChatGPT.

The only\ndecent tech reviewer on the Internet\npointed out that the iPhone last September was sold on the PROMISE of AI (it was plastered all over the marketing) without a single AI feature available to the public when it shipped. Well, now those features are creeping into our lives and though every day I think about how I would like AI to eat all the software on my phone,\nas Microsoft are promising\n, and just be a chatbot, instead we have a host of largely irrelevant and now destructive features.\nThe BBC\nran on its website\nyesterday a rather meek story saying that it has been complaining for ages about how Apple’s AI service has been garbling their stories through its fancy notification rewriting feature. So, if you get a story alert from the BBC app your iPhone takes the story, imbues it with errors and then puts it in your notification feed.\nApple has previously said its notification summaries allow you to \"scan for key details\". However, the BBC says, \"These AI summarisations by Apple do not reflect – and in some cases completely contradict – the original BBC content.\"\nIt is particularly weird behaviour from the tech giant, because I think anyone who has even sparingly used ChatGPT probably asked themselves how Apple were going to use AI to compress and rewrite notifications while mitigating mistakes and hallucinations in the rewriting process. Turns out, they didn’t think that would be a problem…\n“On Friday, Apple's AI inaccurately summarised BBC app notifications to claim that Luke Littler had won the PDC World Darts Championship hours before it began - and that the Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal had come out as gay,” said the BBC article. Basically, it’s like having your own\nKent Brockman\nin your pocket. It is declaring winners of events that haven’t even happened and outing people who aren’t gay.\nThe sad part about this, even for a juggernaut like the BBC, is they are at the mercy of Apple, because it is through this AI feature that iPhone users are going to be largely absorbing their news.\nI have spent the last few years\nteaching AI implementation in newsrooms\nall around the world and a golden lesson for journalists that I try to impress on them is don’t use AI when you can do the job better yourself, especially if it introduces a high risk of creating errors in the process. I can’t think of a more glaring example of how AI should not be used than what Apple is doing here, because the original headlines, summaries and notifications already exist (written diligently by a BBC employee) and they are in your phone for you to read. We agonise about misinformation going viral, but Apple is essentially blocking the correct story from you and creating a fake one right on your handset.\nThe tech giant was said it will gracefully deliver us an update that will “\nclarify\n” the notifications, but it is still a formidable advert for how the AI revolution is going to be bumpy at best.\nIf you are enjoying what you’re reading please consider paying $5 a month to\nhelp support\nthis newsletter.\nPay $5 to support this newsletter\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nNothing, except the image below and the strangely Photoshopped looking picture above. They were both created with Meta AI.\nJudging AI, the legal landscape\nAccording to\nLuiza’s Newsletter\nAI copyright lawsuits will slow down in 2025. And on the flip side we will see more licensing deals. Writers, artists, record labels and media companies have all formed a long queue to sue AI companies for using their copyrighted work to train AI models. It is going to take a while for the courts to figure out this mess, but essentially people are learning to make love, not war. It is also likely that tech companies will find new, legal and financially sustainable ways to train AI models while ensuring creators can earn a living. Let’s all say it together: “Too little! Too late!”\nHow to code with AI\nI advised a friend on how to build an email writer “in his image” this week. He was deep in using Python code to fine tune a model that would hopefully sound like him. He had 900 old emails in a clean format. But every time he initiated his code (given to him by ChatGPT) the application would hang. The truth is - and strangely ChatGPT did not suggest this easy solution - you can create a bot in your image using a ChatGPT subscription. Just click “Explore GPTs” and then “Create” and upload your cleaned emails as PDFs and tell it that you would like the GPT to act like you and write emails mimicking the ones you have uploaded. Then you can prompt it with an email that you have received and ask it for a response. My friend described it as a “good quality bad copy” and added “it often sounds like someone parodying me, but it’ll work for some things”. The question is, are we ethically obliged to put “written by ChatGPT” on the bottom of our emails now? With a little extra effort you can plug your gmail dashboard into your custom GPT clone - get in touch if you would like a few tips on how to do this.\nI am obsessed with AI assisted coding. The newsletter\nThe Pragmatic Engineer\nrecently sketched out the “70% problem” with this type of coding. Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot make the first stages of development feel magical, but the final 30%, refining and debugging, becomes painfully complex. For non-engineers, like me, this process often feels like whack-a-mole, with fixes creating new problems in a cycle they lack the expertise to resolve. Experienced developers thrive here, using AI to speed up tasks while applying their deep knowledge to refine and stabilise the output. For beginners, AI can become a crutch, offering quick results but bypassing the learning of fundamentals. Ironically, AI benefits experts more, as they can guide it effectively. I have learnt this the hard way, but without a doubt AI coding creates an entry point for you to learn that did not exist before.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use\nOpenStreetMap\nis like if Wikipedia was a map of the world: free, editable and built by volunteers largely from scratch and released with an open-content license. A bolt on to the service is\nSPOT\n, a geospatial search tool from\nDW Innovation\n. It’s similar to Bellingcat’s\nOpenStreetMap search tool\n, except it allows you to submit a natural language prompt for a specific location type. For example, “Show me all shopping malls near a traffic light with a park within 300 meters in Nairobi.” Learn more in their\ntutorial\n.\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nThis year is going to be immense for\nDevelop AI\n. We have trips to Zambia, Botswana and Georgia (the country, not the state) already planned for conferences and AI workshops.

The outlet alleges that by removing the information of authors from their articles when training ChatGPT the tech giant was breaking a law from 1998.\nThere is an irony in that by stripping the bylines from their articles and eating them up to create their AI product, OpenAI may have royally exposed themselves to legal tomfoolery that they may not even have been aware of.\nHowever, Judge Rakoff dismissed The Intercept’s claims that OpenAI knowingly distributed copies of its articles after removing the protected information. And really, this word “knowingly” is what we are going to be contesting in all these cases going forward. If OpenAI have a product that they don’t fully control are they absolved from the tasks it performs?\nThe Judge also dismissed all claims against Microsoft, who are a major investor in OpenAI. And OpenAI continues to preach that its models are trained on publicly available data and that they have always adhered to fair use principles.\nAs the Nieman Reports article points out, The Intercept’s case is a novel way for digital news publishers to get a bite of the OpenAI cherry. Stalwart institutions like The New York Times are suing OpenAI with claims of copyright infringement. However, these suits require that relevant works were first registered with the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO). This is frankly absurd and, of course, most digital outlets don’t have their archives registered with the USCO because it would just be too costly. This loophole could leave OpenAI wide open.\nThe hope is that more outlets come forward and when I saw “more” I mean ALL. If that doesn’t happen then eventually chatting to your LLM will be the only media you will have left.\nThe case continues…\nIf you are enjoying what you’re reading please consider paying $5 a month to\nhelp support\nthis newsletter.\nPay $5 to support this newsletter\nWhat happened at Innovation Days in Belgrade, Serbia?\nA huge thanks must go to\nDW Akademie\nand\nNorbert Sinkovic\nfor sending me to the Balkans last month. While I was in the region I consulted with a number of organisations in North Macedonia on their capacity for AI implementation and gave a workshop on AI at a fantastic conference called\nInnovation Days\nin Belgrade, Serbia.\n3 points from my session “AI in Action” conducted in Serbia\nMy session was part of an event that aimed to explore the intersection of technology, ethics and innovation in the media. I laid out how AI avatars are moving into the stratosphere. It is becoming increasingly difficult to tell the difference between me on\nYouTube\nand me on\nHeyGen\n.\nWe dived into the\nGlobal AI Regulation Tracker\nto see which countries are clamping down on AI.\nAnd we went into how organisations can create their own AI policies. Globally only 54% of AI media policies even mention that sources should be considered and protected when using AI. That is clearly not enough.\n3 AI lessons I observed from giving consultations to media organisations in North Macedonia\nRapping to engage the kids.\nOrganisations like\nVidiVaka\nare leading the way in AI experimentation in North Macedonia, creating content like AI-generated rap songs in Macedonian that educate younger audiences on events that are happening in the news. VidiVaka are a social media first company and they are finding this sort of attitude of serving their audience with fun, factual content, regardless of if it is AI generated, truly works.\nAI can enhance efficiency.\nFor\n360 Degrees\n, an organisation with significant reach through a daily news website and TV show, AI offers real solutions to improve efficiency. By automating simple tasks such as daily weather reports, creating animations for TV, and producing clips for social media, they can expand their digital footprint without overburdening their staff.\nAI as a pathway to sustainability.\nAI presents a critical opportunity for North Macedonia’s media organizations to future-proof their operations. For 360 Degrees, AI could attract more grant funding and diversify revenue streams. For VidiVaka, it could drive scalable production of sponsored content. For\nSloboden Pečat\n, which operates a newspaper, news website and three hours of daily online video content, AI could enable dynamic content creation and unlock new monetisation channels.\nWe are going to unpack more on how media organisations are implementing AI in the Balkans in upcoming newsletters.\nWatch Develop AI on YouTube\nWe have a new YouTube show called\nBurn It Down\nwhere I break down recent AI news and developments.\nThe exciting part about the YouTube channel is I will be incorporating as many AI tools into its production as possible. While I have kept the newsletter relatively “pure”, on YouTube I will be experimenting with all the production tools you have heard about (and documenting my efforts in the show notes).\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nIt has been incredibly inspiring for me to consult on a project with the\nCentre for Innovation and Technology\n(CITE) and\nInternational Media Support (IMS)\nto increase the capacity for AI language models in Zimbabwe. The hope is that we can build the knowledge and infrastructure in the country so a range of minority languages can be unlocked with AI. I visited Bulawayo the other week and was blown away with the insights and innovation on display. Zimbabwe is rapidly becoming my third home as in April I’m marrying into a delightful Shona family based in Harare. I’ll be covering how this project of creating language capacity with AI evolves in upcoming newsletters.\nCreated with Midjourney. This feels like the most unethical picture I’ve ever prompted. People casually scrolling past would probably think this was the workshop I moderated in Zimbabwe. It is not real.\nDevelop AI has been expanding. Now our AI offering doesn’t just include newsrooms, but a range of consulting services for businesses across the world. Check out our\nrevamped site\nand our new menu of\nconsulting services\n.\nEthiopia is one of Africa's greatest and most interesting countries. I went there in early November to give a three day workshop with Camilla Bath on responsible AI for\nThe United States Agency for Global Media\nand\nVoice Of America\n. I was there presenting on AI for\nRadiodays Addis\nlast year (I was hosted by\nDW Akademie\nand\nFojo\nand talked to community radio stations on how they could use AI effectively). It was exciting to see how AI in the Ethiopian media has grown so extensively since I was last in the country.\nThank you to the\nThomson Reuters Foundation\nfor the chance two weeks ago to teach a selection of prominent journalists from across Africa on the importance of AI.

Back then you could buy an app or endure adverts so you could turn your smart phone into a torch. Then one day, without ceremony, Google built a torch option into their OS (as really the apps just turned the camera flash on permanently anyway) and POOF the torch app was obsolete. I hope the guys who created those apps saved their pennies at the time.\nIn that spirit, I have been coding (with the rather magical\nCursor\nin Python) an AI podcasting app on and off for a while now. In my app, you can give your podcast a name and the hosts personalities and recently I gave it a shiny\nStreamlit\nfrontend. I presented it the other month when I gave a workshop in AI and Podcasting at Radiodays Asia. Then, in what people have called the company’s “ChatGPT moment”, Google released an incredible service called\nNotebookLM\nwhere you can upload docs, videos and audio and interrogate that information with AI. And one of the side functions of NotebookLM is you can generate chat podcasts from the information you upload.\nGenerated with Midjourney\nSo, what does that mean for the endless number of chat podcasts that are often two blokes simply talking about information that is right in front of them? Well, it might not kill them off immediately, but it does firmly ask us what we want from our content. If we want complicated information communicated in an audio format then you can do that now with AI.\nUp to this point the cost-per-character of a service that generates synthetic voices like Eleven Labs was too high for anyone to go ballistic and cost-effectively create 100s of AI shows. NotebookLM is free and so pushes back against that problem, however, the more existential question is are we comfortable with these chatty AI hosts created by NotebookLM giving us information? Because essentially they are acting as journalists now. They are choosing what to emphasise and how to analyse it, even if the pitch is that they are simply talking about your documents objectively. We already know the bias imbued in these systems and how can we expect them to treat our own documents any differently?\nOn the positive side these developments may inspire journalists to abandon casual chat and embark on more courageous investigative journalism. On the negative side it may provoke chat podcasters to make more outrageous “hot takes” in order to stand out from the slew of AI generated content. Let’s all hope for the former.\nUpdates from our WhatsApp Community\nGIJN’s Abdulwaheed Sofiullahi\nwrote about how African journalists are using AI tools\n(he was kind enough to also interview me for his article).\nI really liked this post by Nikita Roy (from the\nNewsroom Robots\npodcast) as she lays out her theory on\nhow AI will change media\n.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nAnyone who has asked any LLM to generate a picture about the topic of AI will know you get the most clichéd gunk. For the picture this week I used\nMidjourney\nand avoided any mention of AI. But I did use phrases like “hyper realistic photo”, “award-winning photography”, “professional colour calibration”, “morning light” and “sharp focus”. It is a good trick when image generating to not just describe what you can see in the photo, but also the atmosphere and quality of the result.\nIn the news\nThe usual line (from AI trainers like me) is that AI is going to help creators and not hinder them. I do believe that, but here is a rather more negative take on how\ntech is coming for movie production\n.\nThe Public Media Alliance (who I have worked with a number of times) is a fantastic organisation that supports public interest media globally. In their podcast\nMedia Uncovered\nthey explore, among other things, how trusted media is under threat. In this recent episode they look at AI. There is plenty to unpack in this episode, including me chatting to Harry Lock (while we were in Malaysia) about what we can expect from AI.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nThe shiny object of the moment is\nSwarm\nby OpenAI. Imagine a bunch of AI agents working together, but instead of chaos, Swarm gives them routines to keep everything running smoothly. Swarm is a way to run more complicated processes with AI and an opportunity to start thinking of your company as having an AI workforce rather than access to a few simple chatbots. It is open-source so it’s ripe for community-driven development, which could lead to all sorts of exciting new uses. I’ll be experimenting with Swarm in the coming weeks and all the updates will be in this letter.\n3 AI Lessons from the iMEdD International Journalism Forum 2024\nLast month I was in Athens at the\niMEdD International Journalism Forum\nto present my\ninvestigative podcasting work\n. A huge thank you has to go to iMEdD for inviting me and putting on an incredible event.\nThere was also plenty to learn with regards to journalism and AI. Here are the key takeaways:\nDaniel Howden, Managing Director of Lighthouse Reports, leads a team that has been investigating the underbelly of algorithms. They have “pursued the holy trinity of algorithmic accountability: the training data, the model file and the code for a system used by a government agency to automate risk assessments for citizens seeking government services.” They\npublished\ntheir astounding work in Wired and here is a transparent summary of\nhow they did it\n.\nThe wonderful folks at the\nCenter for Collaborative Investigative Journalism\n(CCIJ) are bringing AI to important investigations around the world. Sotiris Sideris and Carolyn Thompson are using AI to dig through court records on gender based violence and uncover stories that otherwise wouldn’t have been found.\nThe Spinoza tool by\nReporters Without Border\ns is currently being\ntested by journalists in France\n. As was presented by Vincent Berthier at iMEdD the tool will look at a stack of data (articles, legal docs and studies) linked to climate change and help reporters quickly synthesise them into something sensible and useable.\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nNext, I will be in Belgrade, Serbia for\nInnovation Days\nto give a workshop on AI and Podcasting. There is plenty to teach and discuss on this topic.\nAnd then I’ll be heading to Ethiopia to give a training in AI with the formidable Camilla Bath. She is fond of saying that journalism is simply a mechanism to equip people so they can make better decisions. I couldn’t agree more.\nSee you next week.

My workshop was (favourably) said to veer off into the philosophy around AI and media rather than strictly being about tools that people should be using. While apps like\nOtter.ai\nand\nPerplexity\nare being exposed as either immoral data hoards or copyright pirates we are left asking, particularly as the media in Africa and Asia, what we are going to do instead?\nIn response\nDevelop AI\nis launching our\nAI\nTraining Lab\nthis week. This is a platform for newsrooms and content creators in Africa and Asia so they can seriously up-skill themselves, code their own applications, create revenue out of AI and share their AI knowledge in a way that they haven’t been able to until now. Let me sketch out what our new platform is going to mean…\nCreated with Midjourney\nFirst: a train the trainer program that benefits communities of all sizes\nMy first job was in magazines. And my second job was teaching people how to write for magazines. I have been training people in the media for decades and I have learnt that Develop AI can hugely accelerate the use of AI in African and Asian media (particularly rural communities) by offering to train trainers for free. In 2015 I started Citizen Justice Network which trained community paralegals to be radio journalists and the key takeaway from that venture was I should have equipped trainers in each of our areas (across South Africa and Kenya) to keep teaching the people around them when I wasn’t there. So, thanks to our\nAI\nTraining Lab\nprominent people in cities and rural areas will be able to raise their hands and get\nfree\ntraining by Develop AI. Then through our platform they will be able to arrange local trainings and spread the word. They will be able to charge whatever they think is appropriate for their area. We want our trainers to create revenue for themselves and we will take 10% to cover basic costs.\nWe will give our trainers all the materials and knowledge to conduct robust workshops that can span multiple days. And we will record all the trainings, harvest the insights and allow this information to build the next set of workshops. AI will be used to help create the materials and lessons in order to stay relevant and guide participants to where they want to go. We are going to help people identify problems and focus on how AI can solve them, including the illusive monetisation issue affecting so many newsrooms. The key is that every person that is trained through us will automatically become part of the\nDevelop AI Community\nand the focus will be heavily on how to code and produce local applications. This leads me to the second pillar of the initiative…\nSecond: an AI marketplace for members to sell and test their applications\nThe 21st century is a world of online stores, but what I have discovered is that people are coding and creating various projects, but aren’t quite getting them to a shiny final stage where they are confident enough to sell them for big bucks. However, another thing I have discovered from travelling Africa and Asia and teaching AI is that a great deal of repetition is happening. So, the\nAI\nTraining Lab\nwill give those who have been trained by our trainers access to a marketplace where they can share, sell and test their AI applications. The true game changer will they will be able to advertise their aspirational AI models (like a model that translates a small African language) and ask other members to contribute for free or a fee. We want to give people the best chance to succeed so Develop AI won’t take a huge cut from the sales in this store, besides an admin fee (we aren’t out to gouge people like Apple). The goal of this is to empower newsrooms and content creators to code their own applications or support fellow journalists by licensing local software. This way we can track who is doing what, open up avenues for collaboration and make sure that there is no repetition.\nThird: a glossary and resource of AI knowledge\nA huge amount of feedback I received when teaching a range of broadcasters in Johannesburg a few months ago is that people want a handy resource where they can stay up to date with AI. Our\nAI Training Lab\nwiki and chatbot will give people the chance to learn everything that has gone through Develop AI since it started. This will be a shared AI knowledge commons for the global south. And, for a small fee, it will include daily AI lessons served to members over WhatsApp so they can stay up to date… as we know this stuff moves fast and you need to be learning every day to keep up.\nFourth: a forum to share ideas, thoughts and ambitions\nIt has been heartening to see the\nDevelop AI WhatsApp group\ngrow over the last year. However, we want to kick this up a notch and give people a forum to connect and discuss what is best for them and their organisations. This will be exclusive to members who have been part of one of our trainings. It will also inform us what needs to be covered in future workshops.\nFifth: a complete AI HealthCheck\nfor your organisation\nA topic I have become interested in (and I don’t think is talked about enough) is the use of “healthy” AI. We have become obsessed with the binary of if AI has been used or not in the creation of content. We should be asking if the AI used is ethical (or at least more ethical than others). We will equip our trainers to do a full audit of a local organisation and “cleanse” their AI inventory. Then we will plug them into our network so they can see what applications they can use from other local members or where they can create their own.\nThe goal of the\nAI Training Lab\nis to legitimately spread the use of AI across two continents and empower newsrooms to solve problems that may have been plaguing them for years. Importantly, we are going to put the power in their hands to be collaborative and to improve the media in general. And we want to encourage organisations to have a broad view of what they want to achieve with these new technologies, rather than just make more of the same content faster.\nI couldn’t be more excited. If you want to be part of this, become one of our new trainers or be a financial partner, please get in touch.\nCreated with Midjourney\nIn the news…\nTests for driverless trucks\nhave begun\n. The newsletter “Understanding AI” does a fantastic job of unpicking the history (and the millions of dollars that have already been spent).\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nI used Midjourney for the pictures. The quality of a Midjourney pic is getting better, but the “intelligence” of the model seems to be waning, in terms of responding accurately to my prompts.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nI couldn’t resist including our own\nAI Podcasting Tool\nin this section.\nHere\nis a demo of the tool in action. Develop AI is offering to create you a corporate podcast with the first month of weekly episodes included for just $95 (4 episodes of 20-25 minutes each). Create up to three hosts and the option for AI generated guests (which are clones of real people who have their exact personalities and voices).

The newspaper is busy suing the tech company for what it calls “free-riding” on its investment in journalism to train its AI models.\nSo, we arrive at this counter: OpenAI has requested for the NYT to disclose journalists’ confidential notes to prove the originality of their reporting, underlining a significant point: journalism, like AI, often involves learning from existing material.\nAuthor\nJeff Jarvis\naptly summarised this situation by pointing out that the NYT’s allegations against OpenAI essentially accuse the AI of doing what journalists do every day: reading and learning from various sources to create something new. In his testimony before a Senate Commerce subcommittee, Jarvis highlighted how journalism depends on fair use, the right to read and learn from existing content to inform reporting. This fair use principle is also what AI developers rely on when training their models. I can feel a murmur from journalists saying, but reporting is to do\ngood\nand this is to make a tech company\nrich.\nOpenAI’s stance is that reading and learning from publicly available content should not be restricted, as long as the output does not verbatim reproduce copyrighted material. This principle aligns with how journalists use existing information to create new reports and stories, often drawing from public domain materials and other sources.\nThe Press Gazette\nreport says that OpenAI argues the NYT should only assert copyright infringement on portions of work that are original and exclusively owned by the NYT. This means that any information copied from other sources or in the public domain should not be considered infringing. And basically the tech company is arguing that most of what goes in the newspaper is from other sources anyway.\nThe NYT views OpenAI’s demand for journalists’ notes as invasive and potentially harmful to journalistic integrity. They argue that such disclosures could hinder investigative journalism and set a dangerous precedent.\nCreated with Midjourney\nThe NYT case is clearly number 1 in my top 5 of AI-related lawsuits. From copyright infringement to privacy issues, here we go with the rest:\n2. UMG Recordings vs. Suno: Copyright Infringement\nThis could be potentially\nmassive\n. Universal Music Group (UMG), along with other major record labels like Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group, has sued Suno, an AI music generation service. The lawsuit alleges that Suno has engaged in massive copyright infringement by copying and using vast amounts of copyrighted sound recordings to train its AI models without permission. This unlicensed use threatens to devalue genuine human-created music by flooding the market with AI-generated content that competes with and diminishes the original works. I created a song called “Cold Rage” (about ice-cream) using Suno\na few weeks ago\n. Suno’s defence is that you can’t ask for a song that sounds like an artist (living or dead), but only request a certain genre.\n3. Andre Dubus III & Susan Orlean vs. NVIDIA: Copyright Infringement\nAndre Dubus III and Susan Orlean have filed a\nlawsuit\nagainst NVIDIA, accusing the tech giant of copyright infringement. Orlean wrote the book that they based the wonderful movie\nAdaptation\non, which ironically I think about often when meditating on how I have pivoted into AI. The movie is largely about how changing your life is necessary to survive. It is also about letting your trauma go… which is kind of the opposite to filing a lawsuit.\nHowever, the authors claim that NVIDIA’s AI models have been trained on their copyrighted works without authorisation, potentially affecting their intellectual property and revenue from their creative works.\n4. The Intercept Media vs. OpenAI & Microsoft: Copyright Infringement\nThe Intercept Media has sued OpenAI and Microsoft for allegedly using its copyrighted articles and content to train their AI models without proper licensing. The lawsuit focuses on the unauthorised reproduction and use of journalistic content, which is claimed to violate copyright laws and intellectual property rights.\n5. Mike Huckabee & Others vs. Meta Platforms: Copyright Infringement\nThis one involves Meta. Mike Huckabee, along with several others, has sued the social media giant for copyright infringement. The lawsuit claims that Meta’s AI technologies have used the plaintiffs’ copyrighted works without authorisation, infringing on their intellectual property rights.\nHonourable mentions:\nAuthor’s Guild vs. OpenAI Copyright Infringement\nThe Author’s Guild, representing multiple authors, has brought a lawsuit against OpenAI. The complaint alleges that OpenAI’s models have been trained on copyrighted works without proper licensing, potentially impacting the authors’ control over their intellectual property and their financial interests.\nA.T. & J.H vs. OpenAI & Microsoft: Privacy Infringement\nA.T. and J.H. have filed a privacy infringement lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming that the companies’ AI models have used personal and private data without consent, thereby violating privacy rights and data protection laws.\nIt is a good time to be a lawyer!\nUpdates from our WhatsApp Community\nHere are this week’s best links from\nour beloved WhatsApp Community\n:\n“This Article is AI-Generated: AI Disclosure and Labeling for News Content” from\nGenerative AI in the Newsroom\n. We talk about this issue a great deal while I’m training newsrooms in AI: if you declare that a piece of content was created with AI can you be sure that your audience will fully appreciate what that means in a world where “AI” has become synonymous with “fake”?\n“The day AI clones took over a Swiss radio station” from\nThe Reuters Institute\n.\n“GAI and LLMs in Content Verification: Proceed. With Caution” from\nDW\n.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nIt feels like I spend my life weirdly downplaying the magical nature of AI tools and forcing people to remove their rose tinted glasses. However,\nCursor\nis changing my coding life. It takes over Visual Studio Code (where I hammer away coding Python) and adds an AI helper right into your workflow. Up until this point I have been flipping between ChatGPT and Visual Studio, asking the LLM coding questions and then copy and pasting the code into Visual Studio. Now, the AI can “see” the app that I’m coding. We are only a couple of steps away from just talking to the AI and the code materialising.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nI used Midjourney to create the image. And it came out incredibly serious, despite me pushing from every angle for a “humorous” take on the topic.\nPay $5 to support this newsletter\nFor $5 a month you can\nhelp support\nthis newsletter (and keep it free for everyone).\nFeedback from one of our paid subscribers\nWhat is happening at Develop Audio?\nFor those who don’t know - we have an exciting series called\nAsylum\nbeing released over at\nDevelop Audio\n.

He predicted that the Internet will become so clogged with AI generated content that eventually the models will only be fed on their own “inhuman” content and seize up. Just over a year later, this is rumoured to be why ChatGPT 5 has been postponed, because it is scraping mostly AI content and that is no good at progressing the model.\nI envision a special kind of dystopia where we have farms of people on terminals not connected to the Internet creatively writing for the models. They can write what they want as the content will be only used in the abstract, to train the new models. It is like in high school when you were asked to write so many pages or words on anything you liked as a punishment. And actually working in the farm would be a great job: the more creative your writing (judged succinctly by the AI model) the more you would get paid per hour. This would be to stop people just Shining it in and writing the same sentence again and again.\nCreated with Midjourney\nThe other consequence of this “data incest” problem is OpenAI will need to invent a tool that properly detects AI content (there are a range of tools already available that are featured below). Currently, these tools don’t work too well, but how else is the new ChatGPT going to sniff out fresh content unless they create one that works? And that magic tool could be licensed out to academics and high schools in their pursuit to police their students.\nOn that issue, academia is going to need to meet their students half way. They can’t ban the use of AI completely, but they might be able to introduce a GPT powered by the course materials, one that is accurate and possible to monitor behind the scenes, that students would be allowed to use. There could be a score given for how intelligently a student interacts with the bot. And if they use AI outside of this bot then they would be punished. And the students would be motivated to stick with the in-house bot as it would actually give better answers on what you needed to know (if any academics would like help building a model like this, get in touch).\nThe larger issue of how we guide these models to help us learn and be better people is complicated. When I was 11-years-old we had\nEncarta\nEncyclopedia on CD ROM. We had recently moved to South Africa and no teacher at our primary school had heard of it. For every project I copy and pasted from Encarta and got incredible marks (shout out to Mr Jakins who was completely clueless). A year later the teachers became savvy, I was never caught, but general warnings were issued and I went back to writing the projects myself. My point is: we are in an Encarta bubble and it isn’t on the kids to figure out this problem… and, let’s face it, the skills they are learning on how to work the system are probably more valuable than the facts they were meant to be learning anyway.\nThis week’s AI tools for people to use… detecting AI with AI\nHere is a selection of AI detection tools that I have been testing. I wish I had better news, but they don’t work as well as we need them to in order to “trust” them, but it is good to know what is out there.\nDEEPFAKE-O-METER\n. A platform that claims to be able to detect deepfakes.\nGPTZero\n. The guys who claim to have invented AI detection. They still have a long way to go.\nDeepware Scanner\n. Claims to detect AI-generated images, videos, and deepfakes. It uses advanced algorithms to identify manipulated media.\nSensity\n. Focuses on detecting deepfakes and other AI-generated media that could be used for malicious purposes. It is also very hit and miss.\n5 Lessons on AI from journalists in Kenya\nI recently conducted two AI workshops for\nThe Nation Media Group\nand\nRoyal Media Services\nin Kenya with the incredible Camilla Bath. Special thanks to The U.S. Agency for Global Media for hosting us. I was there to teach, but I learnt a great deal. Here are my top 3 takeaways:\nThere is a concern that if media houses disclose that they are using AI then their content will be associated with being “fake”. Already “AI” has become interchangeable with “untrue” in the culture and though we want the media to be transparent with how they are using AI, it is reasonable to worry about how audiences will take it.\nThere is a huge need to use AI for African language translation and to collaborate as much as possible to make these models a reality.\nThe phenomenon of cloned voices, particularly in the context of the recent protests in Kenya, needs to be kept in check. And the best way to do this is to educate audiences with how far this tech has come and how it is being used to trick people. Plus, families are adopting “safe words” to use in emergencies and if you don’t hear that word then you should assume that the voice note you receive is synthetic.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nI have finally migrated to Midjourney.

On June the 1st 2004 I started as an intern at Men’s Health magazine and immediately loved that I would be getting paid to write for a massive magazine (though my first assignment was creating slogans for coffee cups as part of a Vida e Caffe cross promotion).\nAlso this month (horribly and coincidentally) the parent company of Men’s Health closed most of its print newspapers. The tabloid township paper, the Daily Sun, has dropped from 283,216 to 11,889 in circulation in the last ten years (thanks to\nThe Outlier\nfor the figures). So, it makes business sense to close the print versions, but the digital strategies for these brands is sparse at best. And what does it mean for a publication to go “digital” in the age of AI?\nCreated with ChatGPT and the prompt “make it hyper realistic where AI is robbing a journalist of his copyright, gritty in the style of watchmen”\nI have been prattling on about print publications needing digital strategies for years, but in the wake of the AI company\nPerplexity\nlast week being caught blatantly scraping and stealing content without credit I can imagine that the case isn’t as compelling now. Perplexity used Forbes' journalism without credit and ignored the\nRobots Exclusion Protocol\n(a standard which sounds cool, but is just a way for websites to tell web crawlers that they can’t be accessed or scanned).\nToday is a “digital strategy” just creating more swill to fill the AI trough? And are any of us going to be able to sue these huge tech companies for copyright before it is too late?\nScott Galloway, a Professor of marketing at the New York University Stern School of Business, said the important part out loud last week (on the podcast\nThe Town\n) when he questioned why scriptwriters and Disney executives aren’t joining forces to sue these tech companies into the ground over copyright.\nIt’s true that some moves are being made: The New York Times, Forbes and others are saying that they have evidence (from using their own LLMs) that AI companies are crawling their IP and not paying them. Because realistically these companies that produce content should be able to participate in the upside. Meanwhile, NVIDIA (who manufacture the chips that are needed in AI processing) has added the total market cap of the global film industry to their total in just the last three weeks, according to Galloway. The high demand for these chips has made NVIDIA one of the richest companies in the world.\nGalloway says the newspapers shouldn’t be doing all this solo. They need to team up with all content creators. And every day they should send out a press release saying where copyright has been infringed upon and how they don’t like it.\nAlso, there is precedent: a radio station sends cash to artists every year for being able to play their music on the air and so we need to take that model to AI scraping and force the companies into an agreement so they pay for every scrape, before it’s too late.\nThough, the wheels are turning in the music industry:\nrecord labels are suing\ntwo AI startups for copyright infringement. The cases are against Suno, developer of\nSuno AI\n, and Uncharted Labs, the developer of Udio AI. A quick test of Suno AI should be all it takes to find them guilty. I created a song with the prompt: “\ncreate a song with a loud angry man singing about ice cream\n” and it came up with the song “Cold Rage” (embedded below).\nWritten, composed and produced by AI in seconds, I particularly like the bridge: “\nRage so cold but fire inside / Need that chill to feel alive / Ice cream lover hear my plea / Don't you dare take it away from me\n”.\nIf I was going to be dramatic I would say that the reason this isn’t working is because creatives, journalists and artists are all pointing in different directions trying to make sure they don’t get crushed by what is coming. Think of how magazines got obliterated by Google and social media because they settled for scraps when they should have been using lawyers to keep the whole meal. Let’s not see that happen again.\n4 lessons on AI from the\nAfrica Media Perspectives\nconference\nI was honoured to be asked to host a panel on AI and Africa on the weekend. Here is what I learnt:\nisiZulu translation in ChatGPT is now good enough to use as a template for producing your content in that language (but you still need a human translator to finish the work). This is according to\nMungo Soggot\n, CEO of\nScrolla.Africa\n.\nMungo Soggot, Mallick Mnela, Paul McNally, Dr Clare Cook and Dylan Bettencourt talking AI at Africa Media Perspectives\nBuilding AI tools exclusively for journalists and expecting to get an adequate return on your investment is tough, according to\nMallick Mnela\n, founder of iHubOnline in Malawi (I wrote more about Mallick’s work\nhere\n).\nWe have to keep talking about policy and regulatory change says Dr\nClare Cook\n, Head of Journalism and Media Viability at\nInternational Media Support\n.\nAudiences are going to change their habits. The existential threat to content creators is the prospect of an always-on assistant which they never need to move away from. We need to evolve our content to roll with these possible changes.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nThe image. And it isn’t lost on me that I asked it to infringe on the copyright of the beloved graphic novel Watchmen to create it… though it didn’t do a great job of emulating the original product.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nSince OpenAI announced the coming of Sora (I wrote about this\nback in February\n) we have been waiting for the crazy prompt-to-video revolution. Luma Labs have beat OpenAI to it with\nDream Machine\n. It is astounding.\nThis video was created in a few minutes on the day the service launched. I used the prompt: “\na white british man who lives in hout bay in Cape town has packed up everything he owns to move to somerset west to live with his black zimbabwean wife. we see the wife is happy to see him and that the man has a huge amount of stuff.\n” However, word has spread about this service so you will need to wait a little longer to process a video now (if you are on the free tier).\nPay $5 to support this newsletter\nFor $5 a month you can\nhelp support\nthis newsletter (and keep it free for everyone).\nA comment from one of our paid subscribers\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nThis week I am in Johannesburg to do an epic AI training in partnership with\nPublic Media Alliance\nand the SABC with funding from the Grace Wyndham Goldie (BBC) Trust.

The demo I found most compelling was when an Apple drone asked Siri, “How long will it take to get to the restaurant?” and the OS figured out the answer by consulting email, text messages and maps to serve up an answer. This is good news for the restaurant (every day I wish I sold food or fixed toilets for a living), but by compressing these steps with AI we are going to decimate several revenue streams that were already under pressure.\nCreated with ChatGPT and the prompt “I want it colourful and pop art in tone with an apocalypse of the internet bursting with chaos and misery”\nOne of the companies selling a product that is about to become irrelevant is Google.\nPlatformer\nexplained in their newsletter this week that Google's AI product, the clumsily named Search Generative Experience (SGE), will soon reach 1 billion users. The aim of this new search engine is to serve up comprehensive answers, reducing the need for users to visit multiple web pages. Google’s plan is to bypass traditional web links almost entirely.\nBasically, Google is going to saw off its own arm\n127 hours style\nin order to save their business. AI is going to mean that services like ChatGPT will give you an informative experience without you needing to visit a website. At the moment Google offers the opposite: they give you access to the web and in return you resentfully glance at their ads. If the search giant doesn’t follow suit and aim to become an omnipresent assistant that helps you live your life then they are going to go the way of Netscape (RIP old friend).\nI imagine the reason Google hasn’t moved quicker is because in the short-term this is going to savage their business and severely decrease how much we visit ad-supported pages. Predictions suggest web traffic from search engines could drop 25% by 2026. If you are a publisher then you better get an action plan together. My first instinct is that a publication’s “unique voice” or “point of view” is going to elevate it above the ChatGPT monotone, but what that does for sound journalism or objectivity probably isn’t great.\nOpenAI’s\nnew best friend\nThe Atlantic\nwrote an article\nabout the end of the web back in April. And they were concerned with how AI is going to flood the world with mediocre AI generated content to such an extent that the web will be less of a wasteland and more of an overcrowded garbage dump. Their worries were that content farms will churn out vast amounts of low-quality content that is optimised for search engines. But if search is going away anyway then maybe that won’t matter.\nAlso, what if we eventually get swamped with HIGH-quality AI generated content?\nAs a journalist and content creator this is clearly bad news. If we thought monetisation was already difficult (every journalism conference for ten years has involved moaning about how little publishers make from Google ads) it sounds like soon that will not even be an option. But if I think selfishly as a user I think the experience will be considerably better than what we have now. The hunt for news and information every day feels like I am skipping from disintegrating social media sites to a random selection of WhatsApp links and podcasts. The resistance from the public for this move is going to be practically zero.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nI have always had a fascination with criminal justice reporting, but understand the huge amount of resources it takes. So, since getting into AI and coding I’ve wanted to look for ways to streamline that work. This is what I have been coding with Python this week…\nYou feed it legal cases and it gives you a verdict. Naturally, it still needs plenty of work, but I feel that this types of application is where AI is headed rather than the work of generating listicles that we have become so enthralled by.\nIf you’d like more info around what I am doing with Justice AI then get in touch.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nJust the image (created with ChatGPT). But, I have discovered a site called\nBetter Images of AI\n(thanks to Peter Deselaers) which is on a mission to depict AI in the media (and in newsletters like this one) with fewer “unhelpful” stereotypes. It’s worth checking out.\nPay $5 to support this newsletter\nFor $5 a month you can\nhelp support\nthis newsletter (and keep it free for everyone).\nA comment from one of our paid subscribers\nIn the news…\nOpenAI, in a glorious move of taking some responsibility, is\nreporting on\npropaganda that was created by using ChatGPT. The company caught five networks (including players from Russia, China, Iran, and Israel) using their generative AI tools to create large volumes of social media comments in multiple languages. However, the underlying message to the public is to stay off Facebook and spend more time on ChatGPT.\nIn\noutrage-at-the-water-cooler\nnews, human rights activists are claiming that a popular AI training dataset is “stealing and weaponising” the faces of  children without their knowledge or consent.\nIf you are scrambling on the edges of trying to build apps with AI then the nagging problem is still that they get things “wrong” (they are prone to hallucinating). This is an\ninteresting meditation\non the problem.\nUpdates from our WhatsApp Community\nHere are this week’s best links and tools from\nour beloved WhatsApp Community\n:\nWe have an ongoing fascination in our community with audio fakes (I think because a bunch of us work in podcasting). Here is a\ngreat piece\non the topic from DW.\nAlso, this is unbelievable. They are aiming to build the\nworld’s best AI pilot\n.\nAI in the culture\nI’m reading\nAI 2041: Ten Visions for Our Future\nby Kai-Fu Lee & Chen Qiufan. It’s a sort of Black Mirror collection of AI-orientated fiction short stories. Written in 2021 looking to the near future - it is insightful at face value, but also interesting to see what the authors thought AI would become before it had really exploded.\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nNext week I’ll be representing Develop AI and talking at the\nAfrica Media Perspectives\nconference in South Africa. Huge thanks to\nIvor Price\n,\nFood For Mzansi\nand the\nMedia Development Investment Fund\nfor the invite and I know it will be a place of inspiring people looking for ways to improve the media.\nWe are deep into our AI training at the Moldova School of Journalism with one more week to go.

"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There was a ruckus between\nScarlett Johansson and OpenAI\nearlier this month. It is clear that the tech company deliberately appropriated her voice for their new assistant. Professional mannequin Sam Altman, a week before Johansson’s claim, tweeted out the word “her” seemingly acknowledging the existence of the movie where Johansson plays a flirty AI. Altman claims it is his favourite movie, though he must have only seen the first hour, because it concludes on the message that it is pointless for us to interact with obsequious computers rather than other humans. The smoking gun is that OpenAI were in talks with Johansson to be “hired” as a voice, she turned it down… but they released it anyway.\nIt showed distinctly that OpenAI’s attitude is that of a creative mafia: they will come and ask nicely, maybe even offer you a couple of coins, but if you decline they will simply take what they want.\nCreated with ChatGPT with a prompt asking to mix Fight Club with the article’s headline\nIn response, OpenAI said the voice wasn’t actually built from clips of Johansson and\nlawyers have said\nthat because it is the voice of her playing an AI character from a movie rather than the real her then the case could be diluted. Either way, OpenAI have taken the voice down.\nAnd since then it feels like the creative world is simply going to take any scraps it is afforded in this new age. On Wednesday it was\nannounced\nthat US magazine\nThe Atlantic\nis being paid for its content to be used by ChatGPT. The Atlantic should be given credit, because on the same day they released an article titled “\nA Devil’s Bargain with OpenAI\n”. Ironically, I wasn’t able to read the whole of this article for free before I was bombarded with banners urging me to “sign in” and “start a free trial” and the piece vanished behind a paywall. This is a problem I imagine I won’t face once I can just access all the best parts of their content through ChatGPT. Vox Media, News Corp and The Financial Times have all recently signed similar deals.\nThe idea is that ChatGPT will freely be able to quote these publications and then there will be a citation and a link to the original source. But if I’m not a subscriber to The Atlantic, for example, then if I click out of my cosy chatbot I’m going to collide directly with an ask for money. This is a reminder that casually reading articles on the Internet from a range of publications is largely over anyway, so why does this step towards AI feel so significant and grating?\nMy first thought when I heard of these payouts to big media companies was positive. I reasoned that Google or Facebook drained the system for years and we largely allowed them to do it without paying a cent. And the expectation that they should pay the outlets that they were linking to only came much later. Meanwhile, these\ndeals\nwith OpenAI are ranging from estimates of $5 million (for The Financial Times) to $250 million (for News Corp).\nThe problem here though is if I am searching or scrolling, by design I am engaging in the pursuit for something better than where I am. I am WANTING to click away from my Google search or Newsfeed (despite the algorithm’s endeavour to keep serving me tasty morsels). When I read a press release from The Atlantic it feels like they think ChatGPT is a search engine… it is not. If I’m on ChatGPT I am engaged in a conversation. I may even be in the middle of an argument with the AI and so I’m not going to want to break this flow to go to a static webpage. If we thought social media wasn’t conducive to clicking away then these apps are on a whole other level.\nBut perhaps most worrying is that these companies that are signing with OpenAI are invariably setting up a “lab” which as The Atlantic puts it is a “sandbox for our product and technology team”. They even explicitly say their editorial team won’t be involved. This icing out of the people creating the actual stories is never a good way to go, but in this climate perhaps the strategy is to take the money being offered because soon they will come and take your stuff anyway and give you nothing.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nI had an ambition last year of building an AI generated podcasting network. I wrote about it\nhere\n. I settled on\none show\n(where everything is AI generated) that I have kept going as an experiment. But since then the LLMs that generate the scripts and the services that produce the voices have gotten better and I’ve started to wonder if an AI YouTube channel is genuinely possible now.\nLike all my ideas these days… I run it past ChatGPT first.\nIf you try to code with ChatGPT (when you are not a coder like me) it can be a fascinating and exhilarating experience, but you can also get bound to routines that aren’t useful, but you do them because ChatGPT told you to and you didn’t know any better. This is why I have always used\nGoogle Colab\n(it is a Python environment that just opens like a Google doc in a browser). But now I am using a free program called\nVisual Studio Code\n, because it is a tad more stable and it is easier to shift your app from your machine to the cloud. Because if you are building chatbots you need them to run when your machine isn’t on, hence why you upload them to a server like AWS.\nCreated with ChatGPT\nSo, first I ask for code from ChatGPT to scrape the web for conversation topics. This info will be used to build the video’s script. I put this code into Visual Studio Code.\nThe step I have often floundered on is displaying my apps neatly on a website that the whole world can see (usually they exist as code that’s just for me). So, I push ChatGPT for this HTML chat interface. This is what I get…\nYou click the “Scrape News Websites” button and it displays today’s stories and allows you to choose which ones will go into your video’s script.\nI’ll be continuing to build this experiment in the coming weeks and I will be sharing my findings in this newsletter.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nThe images above were created with ChatGPT. Though ChatGPT-4o is mind blowing for code, its voice is becoming more distinct when asking it to write and this is making it less useful for creating written content.\nPay $5 to support this newsletter\nFor $5 a month you can\nhelp support\nthis newsletter (and keep it free for everyone).\nA comment from one of our paid subscribers\nUpdates from our WhatsApp Community\nHere are this week’s best links and tools from\nour beloved WhatsApp Community\n:\nCITE from Zimbabwe is looking for suggestions on what to name their\nsecond AI newsreader\n.

If it had been reported on X that an alien invasion, complete with decapitations and explosions, had happened at The Met Gala (complete with AI generated rubble and destruction) on Monday then we all would have guffawed and raised our eyebrows at how amazing this tech is becoming.\nHowever, the exhilarating and genuinely terrifying reality was that people used AI to do far subtler acts of trickery. They changed the dresses of Met Gala participants or put people in the room that weren’t there (but could reasonably have been). They made everyone following the event on social media doubt the reality of what they were seeing.\nThis is not real\nI have never shown interest in The Met Gala - I am colour blind and have no dress sense - but I have to say this year highlights where AI and disinformation is going and just because it is a fashion event we shouldn’t dismiss these Deepfakes as trivial.\nKaty Perry was not at the event\ndespite her likeness being in several photos… she even LIKED the AI generated images on X. Though, she did admit that her own mother was fooled by the photos.\nMeanwhile, every year Rihanna is fashionably late for the event and promised her fans this year she would be punctual. Sure enough, images of her got millions of views as she smiled into camera while wearing a dress covered in birds and flowers. Turns out, she had flu and didn’t attend. The clue (besides not being in the room for real): days before she had dyed her hair pink, which was not its colour in the AI photos.\nThis is not real\nReady for the real twist? Various pictures of Zendaya surfaced from the gala, a few in a blue-green outfit and then in a black leather gown… so, immediately we should be suspicious, but she did a costume change in the middle of the event and all of the images were real.\nShrinking newsrooms have forced journalists over the years to increasingly use social media to help with their reporting. Now, the only way you would know for sure that  Katy Perry was absent was if you were at the event yourself. Who is going to pay to put that journalist in the room? And who is going to have the discipline to only go to “official” news sites in the age of social media?\nNow, imagine this type of trickery being used on images of a disaster or a war. Or during an election cycle? Creative deception from people who understand what could be possible in a situation is so dangerous. And the Zendaya example I think is important for political situations, because if we lose trust in everything we see and are forced to question constantly then how long will we stay engaged? We do need to check and double-check what we see and share, but if that becomes the new normal it will rapidly decrease the enjoyment of our time online. And we will be at risk of completely shutting off from the discourse.\nThis event dovetailed nicely into plenty of news from the tech giants on how they are responding to the problem of Deepfakes.\nOpenAI\nsays it has a tool that can now detect images\n(usually, but not always) created by its own software. It has a 98.8% success rate in identifying images produced by DALL-E 3, though it struggles with detecting media created by other systems. This renders their achievement largely useless, because if the image was created by different software then it generally won’t be flagged. This points to a need for massive collaboration across the industry.\nFrom Meta.AI with prompt “An image of I am contemplating if a deepfake could take over my life in the style of Ralph Steadman with a sense of worry that the deepfake is taking over”\nMcAfee, a brand famous for virus detection and taking drugs with 18-year-olds in Belize, has developed\nProject Mockingbird\n, an advanced AI model capable of detecting AI-generated audio with a high degree of accuracy. This technology is designed to protect us from scams and misinformation. Of course, this will only work if the consumer knows that fakery at this high level is possible and know where to test the content to see if it is real.\nIntel has created\nFakeCatcher (by teaming up with the Graphics and Image Computing laboratory at Binghamton University). This is a tool that can identify fake portrait videos. The way it does it is pretty amazing. It checks the person in the video for “signs of life” like blood flow. When our hearts pump blood, our veins change colour. FakeCatcher claims to collect these blood flow signals from all over the face and instantly detect if there is a real person behind those pixels.\nThe last point is one of digital literacy. OpenAI, in a joint effort with Microsoft, did recently\ninvest $2 million\nin an initiative to educate the public about identifying AI-generated content… this would be a gallant gesture from a different pair of companies, but when their platform is helping to generate the fake content, then it feels like they are saying that it is our problem to sift through this mess, rather than theirs.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nI feel like we are in a perpetual game of restriction pass-the-parcel. For the image today of the old man and his Deepfake, ChatGPT couldn’t produce anything in the style of Ralph Steadman “due to content policy restrictions” and Gemini is still struggling with images of people (as I wrote about\nhere\n). Claude can’t do images at all. Bing tried, but the results were terrible. Meta.AI (on its third attempt) managed to dig deep and produce the picture above.\nIn the news…\nThe podcast\nNewsroom Robots\nis excellent and this week they do well to explain how The Guardian is using AI in an ethical way. It also underlines how you need to consider the resources necessary when adopting AI processes for your business. I am aggressively building AI workshops at the minute and the key elements are cost and the agency people across an organisation have to implement changes.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nIt has been decades since I have had to write an academic essay, but I am interested in the art of plagiarism in the age of AI. This curiosity got me to try\nEssay Genius\nand though it was thin on citations (and I fed it a topic about my favourite movie) I was shocked with how it took just a title and tied an argument together.\nSee you next week.

There was not a single human driving anywhere on the track. It was an event poised to showcase the zenith of AI, but it unfolded more like a cautionary tale rather than a triumph. The promise was that soon human drivers would be replaced by algorithms. But the crowd quickly realised that dystopia was not going to be delivered…\nCreated with ChatGPT\nThe stage was set for a spectacle: eight teams from various corners of the globe, each equipped with a state-of-the-art Dallara racing car loaded with the latest in LaSAR, RaDAR, cameras, and an intricate mesh of sensors. These vehicles, crafted for speed and precision, were programmed to navigate the demanding track autonomously at speeds exceeding 250 km/h.\nHowever, reality quickly veered into view. The teams, including the well-prepared squad from the\nTechnical University of Munich\n(TUM), encountered a string of setbacks.\nDuring qualifying time trials, the cars outfitted with cameras and software struggled to complete a full lap. They were marred by technical glitches and crashes. But most dispiriting was when cars just pulled over for no reason and took a little break on the side of the track.\nTUM, despite their rigorous preparation and technical acumen, only managed a third-place finish in the time trials due to these unforeseen issues.\nThe final race, intended to be a seamless display of advanced technology, turned chaotic when one car spun out on the very first lap, triggering a domino effect. The remaining vehicles, programmed for safety first, halted abruptly behind it, unable to navigate the unforeseen obstacle of a car out of place. The race ground to a premature stop, with thousands of spectators witnessing the limitations of AI. It was a stark reminder of the formidable challenge of replicating human intuition and reflexes. But, I can imagine there was also relief in that crowd, because do we really want everything to be replaced and automated?\nThe aftermath saw feeble humans scramble around to reset their vehicles for another attempt. During this second chance, despite a more cautious start, mechanical and software issues persisted.\nAmidst the technological turmoil, the TUM team, led by Prof. Markus Lienkamp and team leader Simon Hoffmann, rallied their collective expertise to address each challenge. Their vehicle, equipped with an array of sensors processing massive data streams, showcased brief moments of brilliance, hinting at the potential that might one day be realised.\nThe event closed with an exaggerated shrug. Yet, with the right kind of eyes you could possibly see progress. Prof. Lienkamp viewed the event as a critical learning experience. He said that it brought them closer to understanding the complex interplay of technology and racing dynamics. Though, apparently plenty of spectators were so bored they left before the race even finished. They wouldn’t even have seen TUM win the race.\nI have to say from developing entirely AI generated content (like our podcast) it is easier to have a “big red button” approach and make the whole project AI dependent, but that doesn’t necessarily bring the best results. It is a cute gimmick to say no humans were used in producing a podcast (or driving a F1 car) but the future is certainly a less glitzy mix of people and emerging tech blended together. So, expect to see drivers in F1 cars maybe forever, but for their jobs to get infinitely easier going forward.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nI asked ChatGPT to create the image for this newsletter and to help write the main story. Initially it got the verdict of the F1 race completely wrong. Despite me giving the AI a range of stories and information it wrote the article as if all had transpired perfectly. It was only after I told ChatGPT that it had been a disaster did it pick out those negative facts and include them in the story. As always, I had to rewrite the article to remove the generic “ChatGPT voice” that has emerged in the last year.\nIn the news…\nThe bad: OpenAI is finally paying for news content (but way too late).\nIn a move that feels surprising for modern media,\nOpenAI is paying\nthe FT for their content. Intuitively this feels like good news as this cements the AI giant’s ability to ingest training material without legal risk and throw a few bucks to providers for their work. Though I would say that this is too little, too late and basic lip service and good PR for OpenAI after gobbling up oceans of data to train their model for free. This is definitely interesting when you consider the backdrop of The New York Times’ lawsuit against OpenAI (and a\nwhole bunch of other papers suing them\n). We have a long way to go before we figure out the rules of engagement between AI and content.\nThe good: Deepfakes are being outlawed in the UK.\nThe government in the UK has already pledged that the creation of\nsexually explicit\n\"deepfake\" images will be made a criminal offence in England and Wales. Next,\nmusicians want to be protected\n. Professional whiners Mumford and Sons and Sam Smith (plus others) are saying that AI is taking their voices and faces and is \"a destroyer of creators' livelihoods\". In response MPs in the UK are scrambling around to try and update their archaic laws for modern times. But, I think what should have artists riled up is that AI can\npump out music\nso easily at this point that we might not even need their original tunes soon enough.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nI have started testing the various AI platforms to see which one can best plan my day. I have extreme to-do-list making disease. I will happily make comprehensive lists of what I need to do rather than do any work. Also, I have found that allowing the Internet into these AI platforms hasn’t necessarily been for the best - Microsoft’s Copilot is obsessed with giving out links as if it is Google instead of doing what I asked, but ChatGPT will take your to-do-list and build a comprehensive plan, particularly if you tell it your working hours and deadlines.\nWhat is happening at Develop AI?\nWe are proud to be offering more training workshops in AI.

This is a rare opportunity for folks like us. It means we can experiment with AI technologies and build our own applications without being plugged into the cloud.\nHowever, most of what Meta is doing around AI involves their ubiquitous suit of apps. Their assistant\nMeta AI\nis entirely free to use and is slowly being included in all places where you keep in touch with your loved ones. So, Instagram now has an AI bot in its search bar. This feels slightly bolted on at the moment, but I imagine it will become more integrated. Even though Meta AI is available to everyone, the bumper features (like image generation) are only\nfor people with a Facebook account\n.\nTo hear Zuck talk like he is not one of the big evil tech guys he seems to dislike so much, check out the Dwarkesh Patel podcast on\nYouTube\n. It feels like Meta has read the room and understands that they can clear the very low bar of morality in this new wave of tech without doing too much. Zuck is emerging as the tech world’s tallest dwarf.\nCreated with Meta AI\nZuck insists on calling Llama 3 “open source” because it is a term people associate with ye olde Internet of good, free and fair. However, it technically isn’t open source. It is “open weight” which is fundamentally different and not as rosy.\nIf your model is open source then you make available the full training source code and the dataset required for retraining the model from scratch. This includes the model architecture code, training methodology and the original training dataset.\nMeta has not included these crucial parts. However, it has published “the weights and the inference code”. In brief: weights are the \"knowledge\" the model has gained from the training data (so one step away from the “source”) and the inference code is the set of instructions that uses the knowledge to make predictions or classify data.\nThey are claiming that\nLlama-3\nwill be tremendous for the open weight community. And, to be fair, Llama-2 already has an ecosystem where dozens of decent open weight models are released each week on\nHuggingFace\n. People are building chatbots, translation models and assistants for research. They can customise this model more than others and it’s free. Let’s be clear: at this point Meta knows it doesn’t have to do this and they want us to be grateful.\nWhat’s fascinating, when it comes to more day-to-day use, is how Meta AI stacks up against its rivals. They are adding\nreal-time AI image generation\nto WhatsApp - if you were worried about visual disinformation on the platform before, it is about to go stratospheric. And when it comes to coding,\nthe new platform absolutely stinks\n. When asked to write a WordPress plugin, rewrite a string function, find an annoying bug and write a script it is clear which assistant you need to keep using. ChatGPT nailed all four tasks and Meta AI only succeeded at finding the bug.\nThe strangest part of this is we are well into year two of the AI explosion and only now Meta is showing its hand. But regardless of its functionality right now they have the user base to accelerate its capacity like no other. Though, I am serious when it comes to disinformation: these integrations mean everything you see on social media is about to be way more dubious than ever before.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nOpenAI’s Custom GPT Store made a huge splash when it arrived. It promised the chance for you to knock together your own GPT (using their built-in tools) and then sell what you created to other users. The financial side has not entirely materialised, but there are plenty of gems if you have the time to sift through the rubbish. We should all be happy for this\npost on medium\nwhere they have done extensive work in assessing the tools available for content creation. Here are a few highlights:\nImprove my Writing\nis great at finding grammatical errors and correcting sentence structure. It is also top at adjusting the tone of a piece.\nLegal Eye\nis good for writing average legal articles with a dash of political analysis.\nVideo Maker by Lucas AI\nconverts your writing into reasonable videos. They are not of a high standard, but with additional editing you can spruce them up.\nIn the news…\nI’m not sure if this is good or bad news. Profluent just\ndeveloped\nOpenCRISPR-1, the world's first open source AI powered gene editor. It says it is capable of editing the human genome and uses LLM tech to produce new proteins. According to the website it promises to: “bypass the random process of evolution and move us towards intentionally designing proteins for a specific purpose”. CEO Ali Madani said there is a future where AI “precisely designs what is needed to create a range of bespoke cures for disease”. But they also cite Botox as an example of a “transformative protein in our society” so who knows what is going on.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nMeta AI refused to create an image for the prompt “create an image for the article ‘With AI will Facebook finally improve the world?’” After testing a bunch of variations of the prompt I discovered that it wasn’t “AI” or “Facebook” that it was balking at, but that I was producing an image for an “article”. Once I removed that word it was completely happy to do what I asked.\nWhat is happening at Develop Audio?\nOur sister company\nDevelop Audio\ndoes\ninvestigative\npodcast production\nand\ntraining.\nListen to the second episode of their series Asylum (it is available on the Alibi feed on\nApple\n,\nSpotify\nand everywhere else).

Minority languages, particularly in Africa, are in danger of being left behind. Journalist,\niHubOnline\nFounder and general nice guy\nMallick Mnela\nhas become an ambassador for AI in Malawi. And he is increasingly passionate about inserting African languages into these monstrous, English dominated LLMs.\nI wanted to know from Mallick if this problem of language representation in AI is solvable? Or are the resources needed to make a difference too massive?\nCreated using ChatGPT\nMallick has been in journalism for 20 years, but quit his job in 2019 to be an entrepreneur. I met him in October last year in Namibia and he was inhaling every AI development, app and piece of code he could find. In Malawi, he says, the majority of the population is digitally excluded. “Most indigenous knowledge is not properly documented and even less is published online,” he says. Still, a few people in Malawi are pushing the AI sector forward.\nHe’s busy working with Microsoft to make the Malawian language Chichewa better represented in the AI ecosystem. He built a Chichewa version of ChatGPT and bundled it with “reinforced learning”. This is where a user sends feedback if they aren’t satisfied with the answer and a human will check the interaction and make changes where necessary. It sort of crowdsources the tweaks needed to improve the model.\nMallick found that religious Chichewa content was generously available online (and there were naturally plenty of available translations to stack it next to). So, he used this to train his model and it meant that a bias manifested: the LLM used more “biblical” language. But it also turned the LLM into being more tolerant and philosophical, he says.\nThe big problem is that if we don’t start training these models on niche languages now, we aren’t going to be able to develop them as easily in the future as the tech accelerates. “For English, the LLMs perform well in handling complicated language queries. But they can be pretentious and give false information that appears real,” says Mallick. To stop this from happening Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is used. This gives the LLM context and lowers the chance of it spewing nonsense. However, if the language is low resourced (like Chichewa) then you can’t augment it in this way. “The model just produces chaos when you try,” says Mallick.\nAnd lastly who should pay for all this?\n“Media companies may not have the money but they have the data. I therefore strongly propose a collaborative approach,” says Mallick. “The best idea is to forge partnerships so that the media can provide the much needed datasets while big tech focuses on the technology.”\nIf a news outlet has been publishing bilingual news daily for years then it means they already have an incredibly rich dataset. They have masses of sentence pairs needed to train a custom model. And this model has far reaching applications (beyond media) that could create a revenue stream for a newsroom.\n“We need to start looking at how our newsrooms are structured,” says Mallick. “We need to locate the tech savvy journalists and empower them to provide a bridge between newsrooms and tech spaces.”\nAs Mallick points out, the big tech companies need to bring as many languages as possible along with them as this is their future user base. However, they are going to do this with or without the cooperation of the media and content creators. “As long as journalists focus on generating content, AI companies will be scraping it from their platforms with little or no acknowledgement at all,” says Mallick. It is better for the media to be actively involved, generate cash and produce a far better product.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nI demonstrated this tool last week during my class on “Data Visualisation and AI” for\nThe British University in Egypt\n.\nGoogle Looker Studio\n(previously known as Google Data Studio)\nis the Google Docs of data visualisation. It integrates with all your other Google tools and lets you quickly turn your data into a cool looking graph or dashboard.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nI used ChatGPT for the image above. It took over a dozen tries to remove African beads from the picture. They would either be on the man’s neck or wrists. Even when ChatGPT said that it had removed the beads they were still in the picture. And the AI kept complaining that it couldn’t see or review what it had produced… like it was caught in a kind of creative torture.\nIn the news…\nThe bad: AI and jobs.\nThe\nHard Fork\npodcast, with Kevin Roose and Casey Newton, has that insufferable chirpy tone that is a characteristic of podcasts from The New York Times, but if you can get through that then there are some gems in this episode. They take a solid look at what AI is doing to jobs and the economy in the US.\nThe good: people are being paid.\nA new report from\nReuters\nshows how tech giants are racing to secure vast quantities of online data to feed their AI models. And they are actually paying this time. Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple all reached a deal with Shutterstock in 2022. The agreement included hundreds of millions of images, videos and music files for AI training. Prices for training data range from a few cents per image to hundreds of dollars per hour of video. If you are a data heavy platform it is time to cash out.\nWhat is happening at Develop Audio?\nOur\nsister company\ndoes\ninvestigative\npodcast production\nand\ntraining.\nWe’re excited to share with you their new podcast series, Asylum (it is available on the Alibi feed, as season 3, on\nApple\nand\nSpotify\n).\nInvestigative journalist Opoka p'Arop Otto has asylum in The Netherlands. He was forced to flee his country of South Sudan because he was in danger of being killed.

According to a paper published\nlate last year\nit is estimated that ChatGPT is thirsty for 500ml of fresh water to generate between 5 and 50 prompts or questions. The range varies depending on where its servers are located and the season. The estimate includes indirect water usage which is needed to cool power plants that supply the data centres with electricity. And, frankly, this is only the beginning…\nCreated with ChatGPT with prompt “a picture of a robot dying of thirst in a desert, make it highly realistic”\nThe big guys can’t hide how much more water they now need. In this\nenvironmental report\n, Microsoft said that its global water consumption spiked 34% from 2021 to 2022 (to over 6 billion litres). This is a sharp increase compared to previous years and researchers reckon this has to do with all its work with AI.\nShaolei Ren, a researcher at the University of California, Riverside and one of the authors on the paper cited above says that training GPT-3 in Microsoft’s state-of-the-art U.S. data centres used 700,000 litres of clean freshwater, but the real problem is going to come when the public becomes increasingly obsessed with asking their AI assistants questions. The paper says the the global AI demand may mean we withdraw between 4.2 and 6.6 billion cubic metres of water in 2027, which is currently half of the total water that the UK uses in an entire year. I had to look this up, but a cubic metre of water is the same as 1000 litres.\nAnd addressing these problems doesn’t bode well when we also expect our AI models to be increasingly faster and better. We can reduce computational intensity (and so reduce the environmental impact) by sacrificing some precision and accuracy in our models. This process is called\nquantization\nand may seem like a step backwards, but not every use case needs the model to be working at the highest level, so being able to moderate this will reduce the footprint to a degree.\nA positive is that models do use less energy after they have been trained, but a negative is that an\nAI can forget\nwhat it has already learned as it learns new things (which reminds me of when Homer learnt how to make wine\nand forgot how to drive\n) and so an AI may need to be taught a second time (and so consume additional power).\nAs you can imagine there is a whole cottage industry around “\ngreen software\n” that has sprouted up during AI’s ascent. But the real pressure, that might save the environment, is going to be the cost to businesses. Every time your piece of software needs to access an LLM like ChatGPT you have to pay. So building an AI chatbot at the moment is cheap, but if it becomes wildly popular then it can be pricey for you to maintain. When the chatbot on your website needs to send a message to ChatGPT and get an AI generated response you are charged. As a result, already in the bot world you are seeing a hybrid of automated conversations (with preplanned responses), AI generated conversations and the option for a human to jump in and take over.\nThe chatter around the environmental impact of AI is going to increase and, as usual, people don’t want to sacrifice what they see as progress, but they also always want to save a few bucks. This thrifty nature, at least, could slightly curb the environmental chaos that’s coming.\nThis week’s AI tool for people NOT to use…\nI am a recent\nDescript\nconvert for producing podcasts. It is incredible. You load all the audio into the platform and then you can edit the episode - shifting sections around, cutting out mistakes - as if it was a Word document. However, they have recently jumped on the AI voice cloning bandwagon. And it doesn’t work. The promise they make is you can clone your voice and then simply type in the words you want to produce for your voice over. The promotion materials even claim that you will save money because you won’t need to buy any recording equipment. The truth is I upgraded my plan to access the AI features and my voice clone sounded robotic and nothing like me. It is a waste of time. But the new\nRode PodMic USB\nis dynamite.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nChatGPT was used to create the picture for the article above.\nIn the news…\nApple have been frustratingly claiming Siri to be more than it is for years. Their new AI move\nReALM\nmay actually reverse Siri’s lobotomy and make it useful. The model is tiny compared to GPT-4, but that is because all it has to do is reconstruct your iPhone’s screen and label each part of what you are seeing with text. This text can only be seen by the phone’s voice assistant that is ready to receive your instructions. So if you are scrolling through a website you can ask Siri to “call the business“ and it will be able to “see” the phone number and ring them. I mean, that is great… but Siri launched back in 2011 and if a voice assistant can’t do this sort of task then there has been no point us tolerating it for over a decade.\nJon Stewart finally got\nhis boot in\naround AI, though it felt rather toothless.

We do not enjoy the idea that we can be duped by a robot in any sphere of our lives. And this arrogance, I think, has forced us to believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) will never have the power to convince us of a misleading fact or a dangerous narrative online.\nHowever,\na new study\nsuggests that LLMs like ChatGPT can be used to craft convincing arguments… as long as it knows personal information about you, which, of course, it can find out thanks to social media.\nCreated with ChatGPT\nResearchers found that when GPT-4 was given a person’s basic demographic information it was considerably better than a human at persuading a participant to change their opinion in a debate. A web-based platform was created for the study and participants either engaged with a human or LLM opponent.\nWhen the arguments were personalised based on background info, GPT-4 increased the odds of shifting opinions in its favour by 81.7% compared to humans. Without personalisation, GPT-4 still outperformed humans but to a far lesser degree.\nBut the kicker was when humans were given the same info on who they were debating with they did WORSE than when they knew nothing about them. This suggests that when humans were given advantageous information it clouded their judgement and they weren’t able to quickly use it in a way that benefited them. That is a pretty bleak result.\nAnd there is a deeper, crazier level to this. LLMs are largely kept in their place at the moment and seem to struggle with tasks that require exploration or strategy.\nThis paper\nfrom Cornell University which was updated in December last year reckons it has cracked the code to change this with a “Tree of Thoughts” approach. This uses a different way of using an LLM that allows it to consider multiple different reasoning paths and make a decision based on that information (as well as looking ahead and backtracking if it thinks it has made a mistake).\nResearchers tested the theory by asking an LLM to play Game of 24 (a maths game where you need to calculate 24 with an assigned set of numbers) and got it to jump from a 4% success rate to 74%. This reveals that the models we are using for rather basic tasks as the moment have huge potential, we just need to figure out how to unlock it.\nI covered\nAI and elections\na few weeks ago and there is a nervous energy this year around how AI chatbots are being weaponised to spread propaganda and disinformation at scale. We have to take note that when we use ChatGPT we are seeing the shiny face of the model, but they can be tuned and adjusted (with Python code that you can ask ChatGPT itself to write) to create bots that can spread all kinds of chaos. And we are probably at a point where we need to think about making counter bots of our own.\nHow AI can improve your life…\nGPT-5 is coming\n... but there is a good argument for why you shouldn’t care. We are caught in a AI hype cycle of the major players endlessly releasing new models that will keep promising to improve your life. Certain corners of the Internet will drip feed you tidbits and “leaks” that can make you feel like you need to keep up to date.\nBut the best way to judge the competency of AI (and how it can help you) is to start keeping a spreadsheet of all the work tasks you do in a day. This may take some time to build. Then systematically start asking ChatGPT to perform these tasks for you, one at a time. And then in your spreadsheet give the results a rating. When the rating hits a ten, move the task over to being ChatGPT’s responsibility (before that you will need to keep doing it). This is the best way to keep track of where AI can help you in your work and where it can’t.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nI’ve been cynical of “prompt engineering” in the past (where people go on courses to learn how to ask an LLM questions), because it feels like OpenAI are on a mission to improve their service so anyone can get what they want without much effort. However, even the AI giant are admitting people need help.\nThe OpenAI Cookbook\nis an incredible resource of papers, videos and guides to help you write killer prompts.\nThis will be\na rather dry hour of YouTube\n, but is worth your time to learn how to understand why certain prompts work better than others.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nI used ChatGPT for the picture and to read and summarise\nthis PDF\nfor the main article. I asked it to give me the top ten facts of the paper. It’s interesting, because I wouldn’t usually trust an AI to do summaries in my work, but it feels like I need to start testing and displaying AI’s capacity in this letter. It did a pretty good job, but I still needed to go and check if the results were correct.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI?\nPlenty of exciting training is happening at Develop AI. During the upcoming week I’ll be doing two AI online training sessions for\nThe British University in Egypt\n. The first is on 'Data Verification' where I will equip students to select the best tools to check the accuracy and completeness of their datasets.

' with the focus: PLUS Apple and Google are in talks to join forces"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Remember when Mark Zuckerberg, back in 2020,\nput on his best tie and said\nthat there should be more regulation of harmful online content… but added (with a calculated blankness) that it wasn’t Facebook’s job to decide what this content should be. The world’s largest publisher didn’t want to carry the responsibility of what hosting content meant.\nTo be fair, an attempt to regulate AI has been considerably swifter than how we handled the social media platforms. We let them loot us for years.\nIn that spirit, after a scant three years, the EU’s charge against the machines (in the form of the AI Act) is complete. It was voted in by the European Parliament last week.\nThe law will come to life in May and people living in the EU will start seeing changes by the end of the year. Regulators will need to enforce the law properly and companies will have up to three years to get themselves sorted.\nSo, what is really going to change…\nCreated with ChatGPT\n1. Some AI stuff is going to get banned\nIf an AI product puts a person’s health, education or security at “high risk” then it is going to have to go. They will be outlawed by the end of the year. This is fair enough, but there is also some grey area: the Act will ban AI systems that deal with “subliminal, manipulative, or deceptive techniques to distort behaviour and impair informed decision-making,” or exploit vulnerable people. That is large parts of the Internet at this point. I’m not for these types of products, but it feels like it is wide open to interpretation.\nIt will ban real-time facial recognition software in public places. And to create a database of faces by just scraping the web will be outlawed. This is great news, but it comes with a huge asterisk: the police will still be able to use biometric data and facial recognition software in public places as long as they can claim that the data is being used to fight serious crime, like terrorism or kidnappings.\nDigital rights organisation\nAccess Now\n(who we made a podcast for years ago) called the act a “failure for human rights” because it did not ban facial recognition across the board. And while companies and schools are not allowed to use software that predicts what a person is feeling… they can use it if they can claim they are doing it for the health or safety of another person.\n2. AI is going to be more obvious\nRed Dwarf\n(the UK sitcom set on a spaceship that I watched repetitively as a kid) had the astute idea that if humans create robots then they will aim for them to be identical to humans, but this will be too disturbing for consumers and so the next series, though more advanced, will look less sophisticated and more robotic.\nThe AI Act will force tech companies to label deepfakes and tell people when they are chatting to a bot. Also, if you are generating AI media then you will have to create it in a way so that’s detectable. This is good news for those fighting disinformation. However, it is still difficult to detect if content is AI generated, no matter what law you put in place.\n3. EU citizens will be able to complain (if they want to)\nAn office is going to be set up and the folk there will receive and process various grievances. And they are even\naccepting CVs\n.\n4. The paperwork is going to be a nightmare\nEven if what you are doing doesn’t fit into this “high risk” category and you are creating a general AI language model then you will still need to create and keep all the technical docs. These will have to show how you built the model, how you are keeping to copyright law and you must illustrate (in a public document) what training data went into the model.\nThis is pretty huge and really beneficial. And if you are OpenAI or Google then you will need to go through a whole host of checks to make sure your system is secure (or face huge fines and potentially be banned from the EU completely).\nThe answer is to be free\nIf you keep your model open-source and share every detail about how the model was built then you will not be harassed and you’ll mostly be exempt from the punitive side of the AI Act.\nAnd what about the regulation (and opportunities) of AI in Africa?\nThe African Union—made up of 55 member nations—is trying to figure out how to implement its own regulation. However, the projected benefit of AI adoption on Africa’s economy is intense. Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa alone could see up to $136 billion injected into their economies by 2030 thanks to AI. But this is only if businesses in those countries begin using more AI tools. So, Africa needs to regulate away the harm, but make sure that they harness the benefits so their economies don’t get left behind.\nIn the news…\nApple is\nreportedly in talks with Google\nto insert its Gemini AI model into the iPhone. If everyone plays nice then it would give AI capabilities to billions of users when the new iPhone operating system launches later this year. Apparently Apple also met with OpenAI about using its models, but Sam & Co. are now in talks with Samsung.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nBesides the picture above, no AI was used in the creation of this newsletter.\nUpdates from our WhatsApp Community\nHere are this week’s best links and tools from\nour beloved WhatsApp Community\n:\nThanks to Terome for telling us about\nthe arrival of the first AI virus\n.\nWe have been chatting about\naudio deep fakes and how to detect them\n.\nMallick Mnela recommended\na service\nthat checks if pictures or audio are made or manipulated with AI.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI?\nI have been asked to judge the “Best Use of AI in the Newsroom” category for the Digital Media Awards by\nWAN-IFRA\n.

It turns out that SA imports roughly 90% of its rice, which seems bananas.\nI shifted from rice (we mostly get it from Thailand and India) to what could be coming next with how we will use AI to move stuff around the globe. I’ve largely been preoccupied with how AI will influence the creation of content, where it feels destructive, but for importing and exporting it looks incredible…\nCreated using ChatGPT and the prompt “image of people throwing rice from one country to the next easily, laughing and enjoying themselves”\n1. Predicting problems will suddenly be easy\nIf you are a global shipping company like Maersk then you are already fine (and are going to supercharge your business with AI), but if you are a much smaller company then the benefits are going to be exponential. You are suddenly going to be able to process huge amounts of data that could seriously improve your business.\nAI can take huge data sets and make accurate forecasts about who may need your products or services when. This can be according to geographical, historical or customer data. But it can also take in news reports and studies from the web (like last year in July, to extend the rice example, India banned exports of non-basmati white rice and prices went crazy).\nAnd the clincher is you can take all this information and literally “talk” to it in the form of a AI assistant to help you plan your inventory, production, and distribution. This will seriously drop your chance of wasting stock or not having enough.\nRoutes and storage feels like the easy stuff when it comes to using AI. You can analyse the cost, speed, weather and traffic so it gets there quicker. And then warehouse layout, temperature and ventilation so you can store it more efficiently (by using sensors, cameras and drones).\nBut AI can also adjust all of this info in real time as changes occur and it will provide you with an ongoing stream of insights and recommendations. That is the part that is invading all parts of life with AI: a running commentary of more text and speech telling you what you should do. Though, like everywhere else, absurd answers are still possible. However, as someone who has finally started to\ntackle their own fine-tuned LLM\n(large language model) you can rapidly reduce hallucinations by going this route and moving away from just accessing a generic model like ChatGPT.\n2. Customs will no longer be a headache\nGoing through customs always made me nervous when travelling as a kid. After I was told that diplomats could basically drag a dead body through customs and no one would stop them then I wanted to be one. AI isn’t quite that good, but it helps. It will automate the documentation, classification, and verification of your goods. And there is also a gap around legal challenges. It can help you comply with the different rules and regulations of each country by giving you updated and accurate information on tariffs. AI can also help you avoid delays or fines by alerting you of any errors in what you have declared.\nWhat I am seeing is AI is going to allow small businesses to tackle slightly more of their supply chains and hopefully take in more profit. It is going to give opportunities to people to move into certain industries that they might have otherwise found intimidating.\n3. Your suppliers will no longer be terrible\nWhere AI gets interesting is when you think about what makes a good “business relationship”. AI can help you monitor how you communicate with the people and organisations you want to keep close. It can even draft appropriate communication in a tone that is designed to illicit the correct response. But there is no guarantee that they aren’t doing the same back to you, so we could end up with two AI systems stroking each other’s egos for eternity.\nIn the news…\nThe New Yorker ran\na horrifying piece\nabout how people can clone the voices of your loved ones to scam you. And in\nmovies\n: Amazon is being sued for cloning the voices of actors during the strike last year. They allegedly did it to get the production of the new Road House remake wrapped (which from the trailer looks terrible).\nCreated using ChatGPT\nI bought a new Rode microphone this week. It is mounted on a luxurious studio arm that fits snugly to my desk at home. The irony of buying a new mic as the news that synthetic voices are going to ravage the industry isn’t lost on me. But I think the AI revolution has taught us that we love talking and listening to others do the same. If that wasn’t true, the hunger for synthetic voices would have gone the way of automated transcription, where we were desperate for the robots to take that job from us as quickly as possible. But be ready for voice notes to become synthetic (for people who would rather type) and even live conversations to become suspect (with the ChatGPT app you can already talk to it in real time) especially if it is with a bank… or a reclusive family member.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nDALL·E (embedded into ChatGPT) is gradually improving (and was used to produce the images in this article).\nMidjourney\nis still the image generating product to beat, particularly as Google’s Gemini is still hobbled by\nnot being allowed to create pictures of people\n.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nThe rise of the chatbot is not slowing down.\nCleo\nis designed to help Millennials budget their finances. It has “roast mode” that shames you for spending too much or saving too little. In a similar vein there is\nGymBuddy\nwhich designs workouts for you. It feels like the human race, after the pandemic, is lonely and willing to talk to anyone, even AI robots (and at the cost of handing over all their data).\nWhat’s new at Develop AI?\nA huge thank you goes to DW Akademie and Kyle James for hosting me at their regular\nPodCircle\nmeeting last week.

This was made comical / crazy when people asked it to show the US’s Founding Fathers or Nazi soldiers and no white people popped up. There was a bug in the world’s leading tech company’s shiny new AI and the worst parts of the Internet were ready to dine out on the embarrassment.\nPublic figures and news outlets (mostly with large right-wing audiences) said this disaster exposed Google’s long-standing agenda against white people.\nGeorge Washington according to Google Gemini\nIn two days, Google had paused Gemini’s ability to generate images of any people. It is still suspended. You can ask for a picture of a racing car, but not its driver. The next day, Google’s senior vice president Prabhakar Raghavan\npublished a blog post\nattempting to explain the company’s decision. It was a lot of corporate fake humility.\nThe current state of Google Gemini when you ask for an image of a person\nEssentially, Google had over-compensated for the faults of its rivals (like ChatGPT) who have become notorious for producing images that are racist towards people of colour.\nWhen I was doing trainings in AI last year in Ethiopia (which\nI wrote about\n) we were testing AI models and asking them to generate images of Ethiopian classrooms. It would invariably generate a scenario with a white teacher in authority and the students (often on the floor) would always be people of colour. It was almost impossible to generate a picture where the person of colour was in a position of authority. Of course, this is because the scraped web data that AI systems are trained on is incredibly prejudiced.\nHowever, besides an onslaught of think pieces (including\nmy own\n) there wasn’t much of a response when the models were racist against black people. It didn’t cause a major tech company to publicly apologise and prevent the service from creating images of any humans whatsoever. This scandal has proven that black racism in AI is given a shrug and white racism is an international story. Not that I am above contributing to that story. Last Sunday I was interviewed\non the BBC World Service’s weekend show\nabout AI, Gemini and what all this means.\nImage from X via the New York Post\nAccording to\nTime\n, Google’s overcorrection and subsequent pausing of the tool has people in Silicon Valley worried that this will discourage talent from working on questions of AI and bias in the future. Google, OpenAI and others build guardrails into their AI products. First, they do “adversarial testing” which simulates what a bad actor might do to try and create violent or offensive content. Second, they ask users to rate the chatbot’s responses. And third, more controversially, they expand on the specific wording of prompts that users feed into the AI model to counteract damaging stereotypes. So, it basically rewrites your prompt without telling you and saves you from what it thinks could be a potentially racist result.\nDuring this mess, Elon Musk posted or responded to posts about the conspiracy that Google had a secret vendetta against white people more than 150 times, according to a Bloomberg review. The same Time article said Musk singled out individual leaders at Google, including Gemini product lead Jack Krawczyk and Google AI ethics advisor Jen Gennai, saying that they had masterminded this bias.\nOn the 26th of February Demis Hassabis, head of the research division Google DeepMind, said the company hoped to allow Gemini to make pictures of people again  in the “next couple of weeks.”\nWhen asking ChatGPT about a conflict (like Israel and Palestine) I realised that we can use its bias to detect where the media is leaning. It gives an interesting snapshot of the world media’s view because it is combing so much data from the Internet. And the changes will be interesting to track as the tech companies try to curb the bias and news sites like The New York Times start to opt out of having their data scraped. We are going to get a new, contrived version of bias.\nIt is also becoming an interesting “publishing dilemma” for the tech platforms that have historically tried to shy away from such responsibilities. Is a platform accountable for the content an AI generates, even when they are not connected or aware of its creation? Should the prompt writer be held accountable? Years ago Facebook pulled back from news for similar reasons. They found safer ground in being the place for people’s charming holiday snaps. All of these companies want to produce no content themselves, drive engagement and face no consequences, but AI is still rogue in the content it generates and we live in a culture of endless outrage. So, I imagine these scandals, for the time being, are going to become a regular part of the news cycle.\nUpgrade to become an AI Insider\nFor $5 a month you can help support this newsletter (and keep it free for everyone) by becoming an\nAI Insider\n.\nIn the news…\nSpotify’s podcasting acquisitions The Ringer and Gimlet (the former a darling, the latter a liability) are pushing to be protected by AI in their work. According to\nThe Ringer’s Union\nthey are asking for ways “to protect peoples’ work, images and likenesses from being recreated or altered using AI without their consent”. They are also saying they want distinct, obvious disclaimers for when AI is used. Seems pretty reasonable, but deadlines have passed, Spotify are not agreeing and the podcasters are threatening to walk.\nIn deepfake news:\nTrump is not cosying up to black voters in the US\n. Those images are not real. What’s interesting is that the images are being created and circulated by his supporters with an attitude that it is your fault if you get duped. The reality of looking at any WhatsApp group and accepting what we see at face value is already over.\nImage from an investigation by BBC Panorama\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nAs you might expect, it was difficult to create an image on the story of whiteness and AI by using AI. Also, as an experiment I asked ChatGPT to condense our main story in the “tone of journalist Paul McNally” and after complementing my abilities wrote this as a first line: “In a digital epoch where every action is under microscopic scrutiny.” Pretty verbose stuff. So… no AI was used in the letter this week.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nI was surprised to find the most visited AI site (after ChatGPT) is\ncharacter.ai\n. And after using it I’m no longer surprised. Frankly you could lose your whole life in there. It is a site where you can build your own AI character and then chat to it. I predictably built a\nTyler Durden\nbot and because Fight Club is such prevalent IP once the bot understood who he was he managed to pull up images and quotes from the film. The service is entirely free to use and has a buzzy community… even if you are chatting to their AI creations rather than the community members themselves.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI?\nI was interviewed by Kyle James at DW Akademie about “\nThe Good, The Bad and The Ugly\n” of AI and podcasting.

Called\nSora\n, the yet to be released initiative promises you will be able to create short “realistic and imaginative” videos from simple text commands. This is the new world: sending a WhatsApp to a stranger and getting a fully-formed creative project as a response.\nIt has\nbeen cleverly noted\nthat the AI generated Will Smith where he eats spaghetti like a Men In Black monster made us all scoff in disgust… only a year ago. Back then in old 2023 we thought it would be YEARS before we got to this point, instead it has been months.\nScreen grab from https://openai.com/sora\n“A woman walking down a Tokyo street.” “A white SUV speeding down a dirt road.” “An adorable Dalmatian looks through a window.” OpenAI is promising perfect videos from these prompts… or anything else you can think of.\nAnd, at this point, we need to absorb the fact that the outrageous amount of money and effort that is going into creating this tech means in another year we will all be able to create movies instead of just write stories… without actors or cameras or talent… but will any of us have the time to engage with what is being created? Are we headed for full-blown content burn-out as a species where only live, in-person entertainment will suffice? Or is that just secretly what I want?\nFor “journalism” there is clear implications for disinformation. I mean, as soon as this tool hits the market the luxury of believing anything on one of your WhatsApp groups at face value is over. Forever. And perhaps this will push people back to “trusted news sources”. For the last decade or so we have lived in a strange era where we have essentially put the digital equivalent of “a man blabbing at you in a pub” on the same level as the BBC. Perhaps we are going back to believing the authorities? And if you fancy a different news brand that’s fine. Even watching Fox News is better than believing a random Internet person’s AI generated video fantasy.\nSo, this could be good for established news brands. But it surely isn’t great for those beautiful, creative people who produce fantastical video content. They are going to need to be nimble with how they embrace and exploit these tools. OpenAI wants their offering to be as easy to use as Google search and it isn’t… yet. And that is the skinny space where creatives can thrive for the time being.\nWhat I do foresee is journalists using this text-to-video tool for recreations in their documentaries. And that is worrying. Here’s why: I tried to make a static podcast cover this week with ChatGPT and though the image I created was interesting, it couldn’t redo it and make a small adjustment to the size of the picture. It needed to regenerate the whole cover again from scratch. It even suggested, almost apologetically, that I use an image editing program to get the size I wanted (I used a good friend instead). But I can see journalists creating realistic videos and settling for them to be “accurate enough”.\nAnd maybe that is actually the world we are going to move into: a place where there is a fluidity with detail and facts that we can’t quite grasp yet. We will ultimately settle for a yet to be determined percentage of how much is “real” in our daily lives… and live in a permanent state of unresolved tension as a result.\nIn the news…\nAs a follow up to our previous\nletter\non AI and elections, a long dead dictator was\nbrought back to life\nto juice a political party. As a side note, they\noutlawed robocalls\nin the US because of what it could mean for their elections this year. And it is all pointing to my prediction that there is going to be a global trend of the wealthy portion of the population becoming completely “unplugged”. Those who can afford it will hand over their digital lives to managers and agents… like the old days.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nI’ve been trying alternatives to ChatGPT.

The board is funded by Meta and run independently, however, it is a shrewd move because Meta doesn’t want to get caught policing the accuracy of all the content on its platforms, especially when going into an election year.

The\nAP\nhas said that as AI deepfakes become mainstream and social media guardrails are taken down, false narratives are going to be easier to spread. So, even if you catch single pieces of disinformation and debunk them then (because of AI) the larger invented stories will become harder to dispel.\nForbes\nhas reported on how deepfaked news segments that appear to be delivered by well-known journalists could influence this year’s elections and Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs put out a\npanel\nwhere top minds laid out the problem and did offer solutions, but they are all going to take huge resources. But it is clear that governments need to stay up to date with using technology to educate voters and not perpetuate problematic information with their own hallucinating chatbots.\nHow this relates to audio…\nI have been worrying about voice cloning for a year now. And nothing that has happened in the past 12 months has dampened those fears. We are now living in a world where a politician’s voice can be cloned (with just a few minutes of audio) and used against you. And what has concerned me more is how readily we are willing to give over our voice samples to paid services like\nElevenLabs\n(me included) to clone our own voices to make our lives more convenient.\nThe security debate got supercharged last week as ElevenLabs announced that they were launching a way for people to detect if a sample of audio has been created by their service. So, if you get a voice note that you think is fake you need to go to ElevenLabs, upload it and they will tell you if it is a cloned voice. The futile silliness of this being useful when you consider the rapid disinformation cesspool of platforms like WhatsApp is laughable. It involves someone knowing about voice cloning, the company ElevenLabs and the method of screening the audio. Pure lip service.\nThere is another wrinkle to this: ElevenLabs (who I subscribe to and really like) have opened a “\nstore\n” for voice actors. Apple has enticed everyone to chase the dream of running a digital store and skimming off the top. An ElevenLabs store involves you putting your own voice up for sale. So, content creators across the globe can browse the voice store and if they like your sultry tones you’ll make some cash. This beautifully circumvents the security question by introducing a financial incentive. If you wilfully document and sell your voice for scraps then surely you are giving up a major part of your IP? Our voices are for sale… and in the process we will make revenue and muddy the question around vocal privacy.\nHow this relates to everyone…\nThis is a good time to tell you about a new podcast called Challenging The Truth which is coming out at the end of February. It will explore how journalists and activists are reporting on disinformation in Africa. The show is produced by our sister organisation\nDevelop Audio\nin partnership with DW Akademie and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nA different journalist from a different African country will host each episode and tell their own story about how they are figuring out this problem.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nI have been exploring how AI is being used in creating art (it is going to be the topic of next week’s newsletter). In that spirit,\nOpen Art AI\nboasts that you don’t need to even use “complicated prompts” to generate an image. We are already living in a post-prompt world. But in some ways it is a step towards having more control over the AI and getting the results you want.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nI transcribed the video of the Columbia panel using Descript because the GPTs inside ChatGPT that claim they can transcribe are mostly just chatbots that advise you on which services you could use if you paid money. I then used ChatGPT to summarise the video. And I used Bing to create the pixel art image.\nIn the news…\nThe latest episode of\nThe Future of Journalism podcast\nfrom The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University paints a very informed, but pretty bleak picture of where media is going…\nWhile the second part of this\nNewsroom Robots podcast\nis energising and exciting when it comes to how AI is going to change the media.\nWhat’s new at Develop Media?\nI want to give a huge thanks to\nThe Global Investigative Journalism Network\nfor singling out\nDevelop Audio’s\npodcast series\nThe Last Afternoon In The Garden\nas\none of the best investigative podcasts in the world last year\n. It is an incredible honour. It wouldn’t have been possible without funding from\nThe Henry Nxumalo Foundation\n.\nWe have had a very positive response from our two newsletter courses. One is on\nInvestigative Podcasting\nand will teach you how to build a serialised, in-depth piece of audio journalism.

Just at the end of last year nearly 1.6 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya were displaced by severe climate-induced floods. And The World Bank says that predicting when they happen is the most effective way of saving lives and money. Enter\nFlood Hub\n, an AI system by Google, that can predict when and where floods will happen and uses warning systems to inform residents when to flee.\nThe AI uses a Hydrologic Model, which forecasts the amount of water flowing in a river, and an Inundation Model, which predicts which areas would be affected and how high the water level would get.\nFlood Hub can see seven days into the future and covers river basins in at least 80 countries, including 23 in Africa, providing flood forecasting services to 460 million people across 1,800 sites. Though, I can see certain areas getting warnings but not have the funds or assistance to do anything about them.\nFrom ChatGPT: Here is the image created for your newsletter on \"Flood Nightmares, Food Security, and Maternal Health.\" It visually represents the impacts of flooding on agriculture and food supply, as well as the challenges faced by pregnant women in these scenarios.\nAI Solution #2: Food Security\nAccording to a\nreport\nin 2022, around 140 million people in Africa face severe food insecurity, with one in five going to bed hungry.\nAnd a major cause of this? Locusts. In May 2022, the largest locust infestation in 25 years ravaged South Africa's Eastern Cape,\ndestroying five million hectares\nof grazing land.\nReports\nlater revealed that early warning systems could have prevented the infestation.\nInstaDeep, an AI-powered decision-making outfit, is working to solve this problem in two ways. First, by collaborating with the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to create systems that will assist farmers in detecting locust outbreaks and putting control measures in place.\nSecond, the centre is working on AI models that will utilise FAO’s historical data and weather readings like temperature and rainfall to predict when the critters breed.\nAI Solution #3: Maternal Health\nUltrasounds are crucial for maternal health. However, performing an ultrasound still requires substantial training and experience. And because there is a\nshortage of sonographers in Africa\n, up to half of pregnant women in poor areas don’t even get a screening during their pregnancies.\nIn response to this problem,\nJacaranda Health\nis building a handheld ultrasound device. And Google has created an\nAI doctor\nthat they claim can look after you.\nAt Develop AI we are interested in how AI is influencing all types of industries, not just the media space. Stay tuned as we release what I believe is called a “vertical” soon.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nThis is exciting. I have added a host of code to the AI podcasting tool and renamed the show “\nAfrica Loves Politics\n”. Now, our hosts chat about three stories around African politics (instead of being stuck endlessly talking about this newsletter). The tool I’ve coded now scrapes Google News for the top 30 stories of the day and gives me the option to choose which ones I prefer. I also added the ability for me to remove lines from the script after ChatGPT has written it (as the hosts keep trying to introduce or end the show during each new segment). There are a load of fixes I want to implement, but feel free to drop me a line with your suggestions.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nIf you are bored of the arbitrarily flat tone of ChatGPT then try\nNovelAI\nfor story inspiration. Though, personally, I believe this stuff has a long way to go in order to replace anyone.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nNothing, except the picture above with thanks to ChatGPT.\nIn the news…\nSamsung\nwent ballistic\nwith their AI mobile phones this week with features that include live translations while on a call… and it will even work if you call someone on a landline.\nThe BBC splashed the story: “\nAI to hit 40% of jobs and worsen inequality, IMF says\n” across its platforms on Monday. 2024 is truly going to be the year when we see the hype of AI settle and start to understand whose work is really in danger.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI?\nWe are now part of “Develop Media” which includes\nDevelop Audio\n. They have released two newsletter courses: in seven days you can learn\ninvestigative podcasting\nand in five days\nbranded podcasting\n. Feel free to sign up, they are both free.

Crudely drawn recreations from the show perform scripts pumped out by ChatGPT. Back in December 2022 the idea that the project was generating constant content derived from my favourite TV show was remarkable. Within 3 months, in February 2023,\nTwitch\n(the service on which the stream was running) temporarily banned the service because the “Jerry” character came out on stage and started doing anti-trans material. The audience doesn’t laugh at the supposed jokes so Jerry says he will stop.\nFrom ChatGPT: “Here's the updated single-panel cartoon in the style of 'The Far Side' for your article. It features a humorous scenario depicting the comical misinterpretation or misuse of advanced AI technology in a futuristic setting, aiming to evoke laughter with its quirky and witty humor.”\nWhat is curious with hindsight is the defence from the creators of “Nothing, Forever” was that they had been forced to shift from the “new” model of ChatGPT \"GPT-3 Davinci\" back to an older model \"GPT-3 Curie\" and they said that’s what caused the transphobic remarks. We are much further along in 2024 in terms of models.\nBut no one mentioned that there was a pretty heavy dose of self-awareness in what the AI was generating. The headlines glossed over that Jerry was asking the audience if he should do that type of material and no one laughed so giving him the answer that he shouldn’t. The AI already knew that ani-trans content was being joked about, but wasn’t funny. Ironically, in the real world when Jerry’s words were taken out of the context created by the AI the service was banned.\nA year later we are still poking our AI machines to be funny. Elon Musk and xAI have gone all in on claiming their new chatbot Grok is “funny”.  And apparently\nit isn’t\n.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nI have been busying retooling the AI generated podcast so it scrapes Google News and builds a daily show around African politics. The scraper I use is a Python package called\nBeautiful Soup\nand you can point it at any website with any series of search words to pull that content into your program. I am trying my best to manufacture the appropriate credit to news organisations in the new scripts - that part is proving to be harder than anything else. I’m finally acknowledging that most “content” in the lives of people I know is simply the recordings of random people talking into webcams. This may be political analysis or reviews of TV shows, but all content feels like it is gurgling around the same low-production plughole. And though this is mildly heartbreaking if you love creating documentaries, it is encouraging if you are exploring how to make competent content created with AI. Watch out for a relaunch of our AI pod next week.\nThis week’s AI tool for people to use…\nSocial media platforms are forcing us to make it explicit when we use AI. However, currently they aren’t offering a way for us to elaborate on how much we used or which methods we implemented. And this feels like it is pointing to an “all or nothing” mentality for the tools going forward. If you are admitting to your audience (and the algorithm) that you are using generative AI and suffering those consequences in perception then why not push it as far as you can?\nThe pleasure and the craft of producing a product without AI has already been lost once you have even used it a little and the joy, at least for me, when using these tools is to see what can be produced with the least amount of effort.\nSo, I predict content falling into two strict camps: the stuff maxed out on AI and another that is “pure”. And the audience will comfortably flip from one to the other.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nNothing, apart from using ChatGPT to create the “humorous” image above.\nIn the news…\nThe brilliant technologist and human rights advocate Sam Gregory gives a terrifying (and ultimately uplifting)\nTed Talk\ntitled “When AI can fake reality, who can you trust?” AI needs to flourish in newsrooms so we can stop disinformation. Putting the onus on the audience to figure out what is real or not is over. Or rather, if we keep doing that then we are all going to drown in this stuff. Gregory points out in his talk that the AI tools that are being developed to detect disinformation aren’t being made available to the public because then they will also be in the hands of the baddies. The idea is to distribute certain detectors only to journalists and activists with influence.\nThe fight between The New York Times and OpenAI around how they are training their AI models\ncontinues\n. The AI giant is claiming in a new blog post that there is a process to opt-out as a publisher which The New York Times adopted in August 2023. But The Times is saying that using their content for training is not “fair use” partly because they are in competition with ChatGPT as a source of knowledge.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI?\nDevelop Audio has two free online courses that we would love for you to\nsign up for\n. The lessons are sent out every day over email. One course is in Investigative Podcasting and the other is on Branded Podcasting.

Without a feature to be able to talk sensibly back to the DJ (as OpenAI have already rolled out in ChatGPT) Spotify’s “innovation” feels like it has been dredged up from 5 years ago and hitched to the AI rocket going through our culture. Spotify is already using AI to choose songs for you anyway…\nCreated with ChatGPT\nMy mind has been fizzing the past couple of weeks with where audio is going to go in terms of AI.\nThe Town\npodcast (which is owned by Spotify) went deep on the business model for audio going forward (on the morning that\nSpotify fired 17%\nof their staff). To be fair, The Town handled the issues without favouritism towards their owners, but did admit that big flashy payouts for talent were probably a thing of the past. Audio continues to dominate, but Spotify is gambling on AI rather than\nMeghan Markle\nto push them forward next year.\nDespite me trashing Spotify’s DJ, I am busy migrating a few pods over to\nSpotify For Podcasters\n. It is a great hosting service and, of course, free.\nSo, as audio, the most lucrative section of new media, reorientates itself and we reflect on how Spotify is not a media company at all, but a tech company it’s interesting to see what Daron Acemoglu, Professor of Economics at MIT, said recently. He said the future holds a best-case scenario where AI “will try to make humans more capable, more knowledgeable, better problem solvers, better able to deal with complex tasks, and as such, will help workers earn a better living, create more good jobs and perhaps even reduce inequality” or there is a worst-case scenario where AI “would damage the economy by laying off a lot of workers because it will go down a very rapid automation path, it will boost inequality between capital and labor and different types of labor”. I think the problem at this point among employees is that there is no trust that most bosses won’t choose the latter.\nThe focus for AI and audio has been on synthetic voices (including in this newsletter) and there is still an unknown variable around how audiences will respond to total AI vocal domination. However, I do think there is a genuine opportunity to utilise this tech to improve discoverability and distribution. Maybe Spotify should work on that rather than the annoying DJ.\nI have toured the continent this year talking about AI and podcasting (Ethiopia, Egypt, Namibia and here in South Africa). It is too early to give details, but I am bullish about a harmonious mixture of people and AI for content creation in 2024. I’ll be detailing how we get on in this newsletter each week and I look forward to hearing your feedback on what we create.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nThanks to\nThe Rundown AI\nfor this tip. I have been experimenting with AI to analyse my X (formerly Twitter) data. You can request your data in the X settings. Then you feed it into the Advanced Data Analysis section in ChatGPT (this feature is only for paying customers). You can then ask it about your life on the platform and how to get better engagement. You can ask it when you should post and even what you should post about to get more followers or likes. I would love to do this every month with the same content to gauge how successful engagement on X is changing in the Musk era.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nOnly the image above was created using AI (ChatGPT). I promise I will experiment with using AI to create more of this newsletter in the new year.\nIn the news…\nThe\nJournalismAI Festival 2023\nhappened last week. Congrats to Mallick Mnela (Editor at iHubOnline) and Winston Mwale (Editor-in-Chief at AfricaBrief) for representing Africa by speaking at the conference.\nThe Pulitzer Center has grants available for journalists to report on how AI is impacting their communities. They want stories that explore with nuance how AI systems are designed, sold, and deployed around the world. Apply\nhere\n.\nGoogle released Gemini, its answer to ChatGPT. The claim is that it can outmatch GPT-4 on 30 out of 32 standard measures of performance. But, according to the\nMIT Technology Review\n, “the margins between them are thin” and by the time it is released GPT-5 will be imminent. Then\nthis story\nby Bloomberg broke that Google’s video of the tech had been contrived to seem far superior than it actually is.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI?\nWe are taking a break for the South African summer. We will be back on the 9th of January.\nLook out for our new pod (with humans) about the ethics and regulation of AI in the new year.

I’m writing this while looking directly over the Nile River. Last year I was at this conference giving a workshop on investigative podcasting and this year I’m here to speak about what journalists should be learning in the age of AI.\nCreated using Dall-E 3 and ChatGPT\nOn Sunday I was on a panel with Dean Arnett (from the UK), Maitha Al-Suwaidi (from the UAE) and Alaa Al-Ghatrefy (from Egypt) with moderation by Dina Zahra (a news anchor also from Egypt). Here are a few takeaways:\nWe agreed that the best case scenario was that journalists could use AI to lower the time needed for certain tasks and so be free to conduct better investigations and deeper fact-checking.\nHowever, the worst case scenario stems from this same issue: AI makes the production side faster and so it is assumed (by bosses and editors) that fact-checking should also be quicker, while this human element to question the authenticity and accuracy of information needs to stay, at least in part, analogue. Verification is actually going to become more taxing, mainly because of the deluge of AI generated disinformation that is going to be increasingly dumped on us. This report from\nMIT Technology Review\nearlier this year said that we are actually more likely to believe disinformation created by AI rather than incorrect info cooked up by humans (though the difference was only 3%).\nElsewhere at the Egypt Media Forum\nMatt Capon\n, a video producer for ITN Productions, said that\nOpusClip\nis a game changer. This is a service that can take your long video, assess which bits are interesting and then cut it up into a series of Tiktok/Instagram videos for you. It will even assign a score to each video, betting on how likely the clip is to go viral. I tested the service\non the video of our AI panel\nat the forum. I put the settings on auto. It said it would take 11 minutes (but eventually it was closer to 30) and came back with the following\n14 clips\nfrom our talk. The first few are certainly impressive, particularly with how it has identified the key points from an hour of video and added subtitles automatically, but it struggles with trying to translate Arabic and the last couple are nonsensical. What is clear though is the role of the editor is going to change with these types of services.\nFun fact: the UAE has the world’s first Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence with\nOmar Sultan Al Olama\nand he’s had the position since 2017.\nThis week’s AI tool to use…\nRunway\nare an AI company focused on art and entertainment based in New York. They are an inspiration. I finally tried out their Gen-2 Text/Image to video where you upload an image and then simply write how you would like it to be animated. From uploading a single image I simply wrote “The two ladies laugh hysterically, looking at each other slightly and then they both stick their tongues out at the camera” and\nthis 4 second video\nis what it produced.\nThe original photo\nA still from the 4 second animation produced with AI\nSee the animation in action\nhere\n.\nThe criticism online of these types of videos has been harsh (as there are faults and when animated the people look very different), but given the speed and the ease I find it astounding. Thanks to my partner Lorraine and her sister for the photo.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nThis isn’t exactly “coding”, but “prompting”. I built a GPT in my image. I fed it my book and a bunch of articles I’ve written. It is difficult to stop it trying to “assist” all the time. I want it to just have a normal conversation. You can chat to a GPT version of me\nhere\n. You need to be signed up to ChatGPT to access this service, unfortunately. Also, as was pointed out to me, this is why there is no security on the Internet, because people wilfully hand over their identity and perform acts like this.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nBesides from the above image of the pyramids using ChatGPT, nothing.\nIn the news…\nKenya is busy trying to\ncurb the use of AI\nwith a “Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Society Bill”. I’m all for regulation and transparency around the material these models use, but I’m not convinced with how we are going to enforce the rules once they are in place.\nWhen I thought of AI ten years ago I didn’t think of authors suing tech companies over copyright, but insane\nadvancements in health\nwhich we are seeing thankfully around glaucoma detection (I’ve been having the puff-of-air-in-my-eye test at optometrists since I was a teenager). These models are trained on loads of photos of lesions and so can detect patterns that could lead to abnormalities better than humans.\nWith the good, also comes the bad…\nthe US military\nis launching an AI drone initiative called “Replicator”. The AP says Pentagon officials are gung-ho that within the next few years the US will have fully autonomous lethal weapons. Advances in data-processing and machine-to-machine communications will relegate the military people to “supervisory roles”.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI?\nDevelop AI’s ambition is to have a fully Pan-African set of software developers working on various projects across the continent. We are starting to pitch for and bring in work that is helping businesses of all sorts, not just media, with AI. If you think your business would benefit from a AI solution then get in touch.\nSee you next week.

I swapped it for something more palatable (three young people gazing over a tablet).\nWhat was interesting is that I had indulged in a large amount of “prompt engineering” to even get to that admittedly biased image. It proved very difficult to stop Dall-E 3 from always serving up an image of a white person explaining AI to a group of black Ethiopians. Attempt after attempt brought up the same racial bias. And no version of the image showed a black person in a position of authority explaining to a group of white people. I had to explicitly mention race and explain that I didn’t want white people in the image for them to go away.\nCover of the book “Unmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What Is Human in a World of Machines” by Dr. Joy Buolamwini\nAt the\nAfrican Investigative Journalism Conference\non Monday, Ron Nixon (Vice President for News, investigative, enterprise and grants and partnerships at Associated Press) alerted me to the book “\nUnmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What Is Human in a World of Machines\n” by Dr. Joy Buolamwini, which explores the coded bias in AI. As a college student she discovered that some facial-analysis systems couldn't detect her dark-skinned face until she donned a white expressionless mask. “I was literally not seen by technology,” she says. This prompted her to start a movement of accountability called the Algorithmic Justice League.\nAI image tools learn from gargantuan amounts of training data. Instead of billions of words, they are fed billions of pairs of images and captions. AI products like ChatGPT scrape the Internet and we already know the internet is heavily biased (and deals in\nstereotypes\n). Generative AI is largely serving up a white person’s view of the world. Hot takes from certain professors say that we should\nallow these systems to remain biased\n. The idea is that conducting this well-intended “AI neurosurgery” could result in unforeseen or damaging effects. Attempts to make ChatGPT less toxic manually have been coupled with additional scandals, like\npaying Kenyans less than $2 an hour\nto sift through horrendous imagery of violence and sexual abuse and flag it.\nIt isn’t like the services aren’t aware of the problem, but as\nthe Washington Post points out\n, they are just attacking whatever issue people are drawing attention to in the moment.\nThe scary part for me is it leaves the onus to spot bias on the creator. I had a fascinating chat with Prof Vukosi Marivate from\nLelapa AI\n(who are doing incredible work with African language translation) the other day and he reiterated that we can’t leave it to the consumer to spot disinformation. That stuff needs to be regulated and filtered out at source. And I think that is similarly true for these images, because you can spot bias when it involves your own situation, but the confidence of these models means that someone unwittingly sitting in a different country creating images of places he or she has never been to aren’t going to know the bias or stereotype is even there. And after they have pushed those biased images out into the world the AI models will be ready to gobble them up and use them as training data all over again.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nOpenAI upgraded its API, so my code needs to be updated. However, ChatGPT currently only has a memory up to April 2023 so it isn’t aware of the update. This makes it difficult to use my usual strategy of asking ChatGPT for the code.\nThe work around is you point it towards more recent websites (which explain how to update the code, but are pretty long and complicated) and ask it to write the code based on what it reads.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nNone (the above image is a book cover) but when I asked ChatGPT to create an image for the letter today it said: “Creating an image that effectively conveys the concept of ‘the insane bias in generative images’ and its potential resolution is complex and abstract. However, I can generate an image that symbolizes this concept. Let's visualize a scene where two groups of images are being compared: one set represents biased and distorted imagery, perhaps with exaggerated or skewed features, and the other set represents more balanced and diverse images. This contrast can highlight the issue of bias in generative images and the need for correction.”\nThe irony is… the faces in the resulting image were 95% white. So, I didn’t use it.\nIn the news…\nThe OpenAI CEO scandal has been unfolding on X in the slow motion car crash way that the platform was built for. Though, Meta sneaked this in during the chaos: they have\ndisbanded their Responsible AI team\n.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI? I am at AIJC this week and Develop AI is getting involved in advising on the regulation of AI in Africa.\nI was honoured to be part of a workshop last week by\nMedia Monitoring Africa\non behalf of the Forum On Information & Democracy about their report on AI. It was great to be able to contribute and showcase our generative podcasting AI tool. The workshop has inspired me to start a podcast on AI regulation in Africa that I’ll be launching in the new year.\nI presented remotely last week at\nBrave New Media Forum & Innovation Days\nin Serbia and talked about “AI in Podcasting: The Future of Audio Content Creation”.\nThe 19th African Investigative Journalism Conference kicked off on Monday. I presented on Tuesday with Teresa Chirwa-Ndanga on how to use the\nMethodKit for Podcasts\nto create the best version of your investigative podcast series. Thanks so much to Anton Harber, Izak Minnaar and the conference for the opportunity and DW Akademie for bringing me to Johannesburg.\nNext week… I’m heading to The Egypt Media Forum in Cairo to talk about “The Future is Here; Skills of Tomorrow Needed Now”.\nSee you next week.

OpenAI introduced a host of features that have made a bunch of potential startups obsolete before they even got started.\nI had often thought a sort of “AI marketplace” would be neat. A site where people could sell their AI tools. Well, so did OpenAI. The GPT Store is coming later this month. I had also thought that a business where you make people and businesses customised chatbots would be pretty useful. Well, so did OpenAI. Let me show you customised GPTs where you can simply build your own chatbot by uploading a host of PDFs and giving it instructions on how to act.\nThis being The Future, the way you build one of these is by opening up a conversation with the GPT Builder and talking to it about what you want. I made one that converses in Amharic and another that is built on my articles and is instructed to reply like me. To be honest I can’t see any hint yet that it sounds like me, but I think uploading my childhood diaries might supercharge this one.\nThere is a GPT that is plugged into\nCanva\n(for design projects) and people are building ones that write their LinkedIn posts based on their best performing previous LinkedIn posts… there’s already a\nwhole directory of them\n… it is getting crazy out there.\nBut it is still ring-fenced to paying customers who are on the $20 ChatGPT pro plan. This can only serve to leave a huge amount of Internet users and media practitioners behind.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nIt is OpenAI’s plan for us all to work “without code”. That is the catchphrase of 2023, just as I was beginning to learn how to do it. But coding knowledge is still going to be useful, because it will let you work outside of what these companies want you to do with their tools.\nLike with HTML when we used to write our websites just in notepad, but eventually we all moved to services like Squarespace (which I’m ashamed to say I use religiously) but it has made huge chunks of the Internet look the same.\nThe way for our products and services to stay unique is to embrace the coding.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nBesides the picture below, none at all.\nIn the news…\nTwo podcast episodes worth listening to about the GPT creating explosion:\nNewsroom Robots\nand\nHard Fork\n.\nThe New Yorker\ndoes its meditative thing\nwith a feature on Geoffrey Hinton (the “Godfather of AI”). The article is set on his private island which he bought in 2013, when he was 65-years-old, after selling a three-person startup to Google for $44m.\nAmazon unsurprisingly is training\ntheir own AI model\ncalled Olympus.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI? I went to Ethiopia and spoke about AI to stacks of lovely people from community radio stations.\nCommunity radio stations have always had precarious business models, but by bringing a host of AI tools and processes to their stations I think we could really give them the advantages they need. That is the conclusion I came to last week by being at\nRadio Days Ethiopia\n, a truly inspiring event that hosted 76 participants from 35 community radio stations from across the country.\nI gave a masterclass with Ruth Bekele on podcasting and how to use the fabulous\nMethodKit for Podcasts\n. I also gave a class on AI and journalism. People were very interested (and a little afraid) with regards to what this could mean for the future of journalism (and their jobs). Hopefully I managed to leave people feeling optimistic and curious about how they can use these tools in their work.\nA huge thanks to Sofie Gullberg, Fojo’s Programme Manager in Ethiopia, and her team for the interesting chats and organising the event. Thanks to Karolina Luczak Santana, Barbara Gruber and Mikias Sebsibe from DW Akademie for every way that they helped me during the week. It was great to see Professor Franz Krüger there who continues to do phenomenal work in the community radio space all around the world. I look forward to figuring out how to take these stations on the next step towards using all this AI stuff to make better content.\nCreated with ChatGPT\nSee you next week.

She said their lab takes “pitches” from all across the organisation (from people at any level) on where they would like to see automation, intelligence tools and GenAI used in the media creation process. They are big on being human-centred, but they are bullish on getting everyone involved and as much grunt work automated to leave more time in the day for deeper analysis and stronger investigations.\nThis philosophy is similar to what I have been advocating for: transparency and involvement at every level is crucial for media organisations to get through this on top.\nCreated by Dall-E 3 and the prompt “create an image at the one & only hotel in Cape Town where african business innovators all talk about AI and jump around when they solve the media's problems”\nOther great points from Quinonez:\nIf you have limited resources as a media organisation there is no shame in taking half measures. Incorporating these tools can be a gradual, iterative process. Use elaborate prompts, for example, instead of training a whole new model.\nThe time where we can guarantee that a chatbot won’t hallucinate is getting closer.\nThis idea I loved: not every newsroom problem can be solved with AI. At least the tools we are talking about, they can only help if the task you need help with is a linguistic task and if you can transform your problem into a predictive problem. Because it is good to remember that these models don’t “know” anything, but they “predict”.\nThese tools can extend human skills in much the same way as the Internet extended our memory.\nDevelop AI’s Paul McNally was a guest speaker at Bloomberg’s Africa Business Media Innovators 2023.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nFor the generative podcast this week I added a section of code where you can remove lines from the episode after it has been scripted, but before you send it to ElevenLabs to create the audio. I know to give options to tinker with what has been generated is against the spirit of the experiment, but we need to get closer to this being a viable podcast producing service. And that is going to mean a mixture of the generative and human oversight.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nBesides from the image above, no AI was used. And I am realising that what is going to hold back huge amounts of content becoming generative isn’t just how the audience reacts, but because people LIKE creating. And people (including me) will probably keep writing or editing to their financial detriment long past the point where they have to.\nIn the news…\nLots of\nnews out of OpenAI\nthis week… most importantly the drop in price. GPT-4 Turbo is 3x cheaper for input and 2x cheaper for output compared to other GPT-4 pricing. The problem with scaling a ChatGPT product is that if it needs to obsessively access ChatGPT then the cost can get out of hand. These price drops are gradually mitigating that problem.\nThe next piece of OpenAI news is probably more exciting. They are rolling out\nAssistants API\n. This will help you build an assistant for your app or website without the need to write any code. We will explore this service in an upcoming newsletter.\nFrom The Guardian this is\na thorough read\nabout “the promise and perils of AI in Africa”.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI? We are expanding beyond media into helping other start-ups.\nMy background is clearly as a journalist. I started in magazines and honestly, when I left university I just wanted to write features for SL magazine until the day I died. However, the world has changed and thankfully so have I.\nI’m finding more people are asking me about how AI can help their start-ups that are outside of the media sphere. The tools that are useful for media companies I am finding can also apply to almost every other industry. So, look out for ways that we are helping non-media start-ups and NGOs with AI tools and strategies so they can create better products and run better businesses.\nOur sister organisation\nDevelop Audio\ncontinues to promote quality audio across the African continent. I’m in Ethiopia this week (my first time here when I’m allowed outside of the airport) for Radio Days Ethiopia to give a workshop with Ruth Bekele on creating podcasts with the incomparable\nMethodKit\n. I am also giving a presentation on AI in podcasting.\nA huge thanks has to go to\nDW Akademie\nfor bringing me here and their unbelievable dedication to growing podcasting in Africa.

They were varied and brilliant. Election maps, AI chatbots, African language translation initiatives… all with an eye towards enhancing media in Africa (while also making some money).\nThe Innovation Lab 2023 is a truly remarkable initiative, run by\nPeter Deselaers\n, DW Akademie Program Director for Namibia & Southern Africa. Here is what the teams have in the works:\nJune Shimuoshili\n, a journalist, and\nAmanda Munal\n, an IT Technician, from\nThe Namibian,\nan established daily independent daily that has been around since 1985, want to solve the engagement problem they have with their readers. They have realised that an AI chatbot could be more responsive than their staff to readers’ questions… and hopefully they’ll get the bot to correspond in Oshiwambo (a local Namibian language). On that,\nAxel Mukwena\nruns\nMeyabase\n(in his spare time) which is all over trying to solve for African language translation.\nNext,\nMallick Mnela\nand\nMary Kadewere\nfrom\niHubOnline\nin Malawi are a true power team in using and building new AI tools. They are focusing on using AI to interrogate government budget documents (which are hard to understand for most) and making them accessible to all.\nWhen I started going to innovation type labs back in 2015 with Citizen Justice Network (which was formed at Wits University) we were pitching the pairing of community paralegals with community radio stations to produce more justice content for millions of listeners. There was impact, but no tech (besides radio) and certainly no coding.\nThis blend of tech and the personal is prominent in the project from\nBloggers of Zambia\n.\nRichard Mulonga\nand\nNumeral Daka\nare going after revolutionising fact-checking. We sat for long sessions during the week discussing how to best tackle the problem of disinformation. They are combining tech and an on-the ground network of citizens who can help verify bits of dubious information. I genuinely think this could be a game changer.\nCreated using Dall-E 3 and prompt “create an image of a group of african media innovators in Namibia experimenting, photorealistic”\nZimbabwe is in trouble.\nTanaka Mrewa\nfrom the\nCenter for Innovation and Technology (CITE)\nregaled us over lunch with tales about the inflation and media oppression happening in her country, but also how the gap is wide open for extreme innovation. Along with her colleague\nSean Ndlovu\nthey are proposing an exciting shift to making their content searchable through an AI chatbot (using the\nPerplexity\nAPI) and monetising it with a paywall.\nJoel Konopo\nand\nKeneilwe Pono Lephoi\nfrom the\nINK Center for Investigative Journalism\nin Botswana are passionate about reversing voter apathy. Joel is intense when it comes to getting better election data in the hands of journalists so they can produce inspiring stories. They are developing a data project to make this a reality.\nLesotho was represented by\nBilly Ntaote\nand\nRetselisitsoe Khabo\nfrom the\nMNN Center for Investigative Reporting.\nThey are perfectly placed to produce their crime map, because they have the experience of investigative journalists so they can find the data necessary AND they have the skills in tech to display it perfectly. The methods they used to extract the crime data for their map were thorough and the map (when it shows reliable crime information for the country) is going to provide a real service.\nFinally,\nVitus-Gregory Gondwe\nfrom\nPIJ\nand\nDaniel Mvalo\nfrom\nmHub\nin Malawi are using AI to make investigative journalism more accessible to readers. They are an inspiring team - a true combination of an experienced investigative journalist and a young tech expert pooling their resources to make media better.\nI will be following up with these teams in this newsletter as they progress with their projects.\nThis week’s AI tool for journalists to use…\nThe future is chat. And advertising is still around. So, this is pretty interesting: a\nplatform\nthat builds you customised adverts for your chatbot.\nA quick retraction: I slagged off\nAdobe’s Enhance Speech\ntool a few weeks ago (it is meant to turn dodgy voice over recordings into studio quality) and I have since discovered that it does work, but only on the paid tier. If you are paying then you can adjust the strength of the enhancement and then if you make it less extreme the results sound more human.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nI am busy building a more friendly user interface for the podcast creation tool (so it can be opened up for general use).

Because you can imagine certain newsrooms using AI as an opportunity to reduce costs, fire staff and produce the same product (just cheaper and faster).\nHowever, the next wave of content creation is going to be brutal. People are obsessed with everything getting worse because of AI, but really it is going to mean that the floor for content quality is going to get considerably higher. Which means that newsrooms, instead of cutting costs, are going to have to use AI, retain their staff and aim to make their content way, way better to be able to charge or attract anyone. That’s the only way to avoid the coming content apocalypse. To be frank, for any of us to survive we are going to need to embrace AI and retain smart, flexible honest people in our newsrooms to make our content infinitely better… the competition is about to get insane.\nCreated using www.bing.com/images/create and prompt “AI strategies for newsrooms... and the content apocalypse that is coming”\nSo, if they are staying on the payroll, what should we teach our journalists? When the world keeps moving, what can we ask them to latch on to? We don’t want to teach journalists how to use specific tools, but how to find good ones. They should be able to vet the tools and incorporate them into their workflows. It is not possible to do the tool integration “seamlessly” even though that is what we all want. In a few months (or weeks) the tools will change, everything is going to keep changing and our workflow platforms are going to go out of date. We need to adopt a life of flexibility. And there is going to be a great deal of tool duplication if we are not careful. In our\nWhatsApp Community\nwe have asked the journalists to appeal to each other to test their apps and eventually become each other’s first customers.\nI think journalists are going to be forced to break down their processes into tiny details in order to investigate which parts can be automated. However, there needs to be a trust between the journalists and the bosses to say that no one is going to be retrenched once the journalist reveals their tasks and brainstorms how to automate them. We don’t want journalists to feel like they are being asked to design their own electric chair.\nWhat would be fantastic is an ongoing dialogue between what is being built by an organisation’s tech department and what is needed by the newsroom. Also, there needs to be a way to track how AI is improving the final product. This is key and not something people are talking about too much: you want a company’s internal metrics to judge how the product is getting better through the AI adoption process.\nThe idea of a policy for your media business is a good one, but you need to ask why you need one and how that folds into the training of your staff and products you might want to adopt and build. It also needs to be produced with input from your journalists, because they want the product to be ethical more than anyone. And your policy will change (probably soon) and that’s okay.\nWhen it comes to disinformation my prediction is that for the entirely fabricated stuff - fake stories, images and videos - people are going to choose to subscribe to something that will block all that out (like how we dealt with spam decades ago). But the content that is incorrect that people are actively seeking out (and won’t believe is wrong no matter what you tell them) is about to become more rampant.\nLastly, what will this do to investigative journalism? The outlook is largely positive. People are seeing an opportunity to find insights and stories in huge data sets. I feel for this type of journalism there could be a larger problem in terms of checking what the AI spits out. Because in pure narrative writing a journalist can pretty easily spot where the AI has gone off script, but if a tiny newsroom gives it a massive dataset then they might not have the manpower to check what it serves up and if asked to “show their working” they might not be able to do so.\nDevelop AI helps newsrooms (no matter what their size) with their AI strategies. If you are interested, get in touch.\nThis week’s AI tool for journalists to use…\nIn\nthis article for One World Media\n, Ruona Meyer, a superb journalist and good friend, gives a treasure trove of insights around\nAI tools for journalists\n. She is joined by Prof. Charlie Beckett, founding director of Polis. One recommendation from Meyer I found very helpful was\nGPTZero\n. It’s an AI-detection tool. It is trained to detect ChatGPT, GPT4, Bard, LLaMa, and other AI models. Let the arms race begin!\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nA huge thanks to\nThe Podcast Sessions\nfor featuring our AI podcast creation app. I’ve been thinking about what is next for the tool. I want to feed the transcripts for each episode into a database and then when the prompt creates a new script I want it to access this database and let that inform what the hosts say. At the moment there is no history or chemistry between the hosts and that is because each new script is created in a vacuum. The changes between episodes come from the different content of the new URL and the whims of the updated ChatGPT model. But if they started to have a HISTORY and comment on what they had said in the past, well that would definitely give the impression of them being more human.\nYou can listen to our entirely synthetic podcast (based on this newsletter) on\nSpotify\n.\nMore from our\ncoding blog\n.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nVery little besides the image from\nBing\nas usual. I have to admit I tried putting all my conference notes into ChatGPT to write the main section above and the TONE was incredibly grating. I didn’t use anything that it gave me. So, I just wrote it the slow way like a loser.\nIn the news…\nI don’t think we are close to experiencing peak AI media paranoia, but last week saw a flurry of\narticles\nand videos about\nAI generated girlfriends\n(and how they are destroying young men). The most innovative version is one influencer created an AI bot of herself named Caryn. She gained 1 000 boyfriends in a week with a waiting list of 15 000 more. It feels like every business is trying to create a personalised “assistant” for their customers but there is a dimension of hysteria from general news outlets if these bots are used to talk about sex and emotions.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI? Jamfest in Johannesburg, Innovation Lab in Windhoek & The Egypt Media Forum in Cairo\nI am having a brilliant time at\nJamfest\nin Johannesburg. I’ll be doing a workshop today (Tuesday) on AI in Journalism. And I will also be part of a session in the afternoon talking about the fabulous\nMethodKit For Podcasts\n.\nI would like to congratulate the incredible organisations from Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Malawi and Lesotho that will be in Windhoek for the Innovation Lab next week. They will be working on AI solutions for African media that are destined to have a big impact.

"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was back in 2018 that China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency\nlaunched\nwhat they claimed (at the time) to be the world’s first AI news anchor. The dubious mouth movements and monotonous voice were heavily criticised at the time (coupled with a growing rumble of paranoia around what this could mean for job security in the media).\nCreated using www.bing.com/images/create and prompt “zimbabwean AI news reader doing her best but not taking your job, photo realistic”\nSpin forward to 2023 and we have\nAlice\n, produced by the Bulawayo-based Centre for Innovation and Technology (CITE) which lit up the second day of the “\nEmpowering African AI\n” conference this week.\nAlice has\nher own account on X\nwhere she posts news bulletins that are performed in a classic newsreader’s voice.\n“AI is a tool that is controlled by a human being. This is why I don’t believe that AI is an immediate threat to journalists,” said Director of CITE, Zenzele Ndebele from his podium at the conference. “AI will not take jobs from journalists at CITE. AI cannot go out and gather news, but AI can complement the work that we are doing.”\nHe said CITE spent US$10 ,000 this year conducting research and figuring out how to use AI. And he also stressed that junior journalists are already using AI in secret to do their jobs more efficiently.\n“Alice” the Zimbabwean AI newsreader.\nAssociate Professor Mphathisi Ndlovu of the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) touched on how Alice struggles with pronouncing certain African words and that this highlights a growing need to address synthetic African language development. To be honest, whoever cracks this language issue in Africa will have a very prosperous start-up on their hands.\nEven before I found out about CITE’s AI progress, their newsletter\nAsakhe Daily\nguided me through the recent Zim election. They are worth\nfollowing\n.\nThis week’s AI tool for journalists to use…\nThe market in transcribing is being slowly cornered by\nDescript\n, which is positioning itself as an all-round editing tool for audio and video, but minute taking is another beast.\nFireflies.ai\ndoesn’t just transcribe your Zoom conversations, but compiles pretty competent summaries and sends them out to everyone who was on the call. It really works, but the paid version needs to be cheaper.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nAfter writing\nlast week’s letter\non using AI tools for podcast creation, I dug out the code for my podcast app (produced in\nColab\n) and updated a few things. The new model for ChatGPT is gpt-4-0613 so I needed to update the parts that access the OpenAI API and this resulted in considerably better responses from the hosts and more natural banter between them.\nI also thought that instead of it scraping for the day’s news in Johannesburg a better way to showcase what the app is doing is to turn it in on itself. So, I gave the user the option to input a URL (as a basis for the podcast episode) and then fed it our own Develop AI newsletter. Writing that sentence makes feels like the project is the height of self-indulgence, but hopefully if people can see exactly what the app is working with as a starting point then we can chart its progress. The only rule is all mistakes (and tangents) produced by the AI are kept in deliberately. I’ll be documenting any changes I make to the code in this letter as we go along.\nYou can listen to the podcast (simply called Develop AI)\nhere\n. The hosts are called Amina, Will and Khaya… if you have heard my voice before you’ll probably recognise the Will host, but I didn’t record a word for the show (I just fed it old voice over from my podcast\nAlibi\n). New episodes are released on Thursday and it’s also on\nSpotify\n.\nDiscover more on our\ncoding blog\n.\nCover art for our new podcast, entirely generated with AI. Image created with www.bing.com/images/create\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nNo text help, but the main image was produced by Bing. Same with the podcast cover art above (and naturally the podcast itself).\nSubscribe now\nShare Develop AI by Paul McNally\nIn the news…\nGoogle has backed\n11 start-ups to work on AI in Africa\n. These start-ups (from Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Senegal and others) are using AI to solve big challenges, from improving healthcare to boosting the economy. There are definitely interesting projects here, particularly for small businesses, but weirdly nothing strictly from the media sector.\nBig media companies are gradually releasing their editorial stances on AI. The latest is an insightful take from Deutsche Welle. In this\narticle\nEditor-in-Chief Manuela Kasper Claridge is firm that journalists will stay in control, but that they are already using tools to analyse large data sets. However, she came down hard on chatbots. She said, “They can provide inspiration but not reliable information. They make mistakes and are not transparent about where they draw their information. We will not use AI chatbots directly as sources.”\nWhat’s new at Develop AI? We are going to Namibia to help innovators discover their potential!\nI am heading to Windhoek the week after next to assist teams from Namibia, Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Lesotho so they can produce AI products for their newsrooms. It is being put together by DW Akademie and I am absolutely honoured to be a part of it. This really is the lifeblood of what needs to happen in African media with these new technologies. Look out for the innovators from these countries (and their products) being featured in this newsletter in the future.\nIn the meantime, there is still time to sign up for\nJamfest\n- it is free and will run from the 16th of October to the 19th of October next week in Johannesburg. I’ll be on\na panel about AI-driven journalism\non the Tuesday.\nSee you next week.

In 2019 I created\nWhat’s Crap on WhatsApp?\na podcast voice note show that was designed to debunk the swamp of WhatsApp with a handy, shareable audio show.\nSurely, the next step in that process is to create a generative AI bot that is plugged right into a WhatsApp number which people can quiz about misinformation and disinformation in Africa? Well,\nit’s here\n. And let me tell you, for someone who six months ago didn’t even know Python was the name of a programming language it came about through a very steep learning curve.\nOur new generative AI chatbot built right into WhatsApp\nOur dedicated WhatsApp number is plugged right into ChatGPT with a prompt to build arguments to counter disinformation in your life. You text the number with an example of an incorrect argument that you’ve heard or read about and it will give you some ways to persuade that person of the correct viewpoint. It then builds every conversation it has into a database that, in theory, should help journalists report on and counter disinformation going forward.\nYou can chat to our disinformation WhatsApp bot (called Uni)\nhere\n(the number is +27 79 219 8649). And if you have feedback on the bot\njoin this group\nin our WhatsApp Community where we are chatting about AI and media and give us your thoughts.\nThe ambition for these types of AI initiatives is to democratise access to powerful tools like generative AI and by extension broaden the kinds of people that interact and teach these new overlords. They are needed to bring generative AI to Africa in an accessible way.\nIf you’d like more info on how we built the bot and how you could make one for your own news organisation then you can reply to this mail and ask us about one of our paid workshops or mentoring sessions. We will guide you through all the necessary steps.\nThis week’s AI tool for journalists to use…\nThe mantra of the moment is use so-and-so tool so you can “focus on your story” but I think any normal journalist can spot that kind of language as HR pandering used to placate you just before you lose your job. However, Google’s\nJournalist Studio\nand particularly\nPinpoint\n, at least for now, is intent on making your work more efficient.\nIt uses Google Search, AI, and machine learning to help journalists keep track of the huge amount of documents they need for an investigation. So, you upload and then search hundreds of thousands of documents, images, emails, hand-written notes and audio files for specific words. The game changer is the audio component: up to two hours can be uploaded and transcribed into searchable text files.\nOne tool not to use…\nAdobe’s much publicised push into AI has given a mixed bag of results. I’ve had the most contact with their enhance audio tool\nwhich boasts to use AI to solve all your problems\n. Cleaning audio has gone from largely impossible for the layman to breathtaking in the last ten years, but Adobe claims now that you just need to upload a file and click one button and AI will transform your janky audio into studio quality. It does not work on any level. Stripping out breaths where you need them and making your voice overly robotic. We are still a way off.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nYou need APIs to work with AI.\nMany AI functions, such as natural language processing or image recognition, are available through APIs. In reality this is just a long password that you need to put into your python code to access a service. For example, our WhatsApp misinformation bot talks to several APIs, including the one you get from Open AI when you have the paid account. Also, if you are going to be sharing your code (or even submitting it to ChatGPT) don’t hard code your API passwords into the code you are sharing because if anyone gets hold of that they can abuse your account. Rather keep them in a separate secure doc and point the code to access them.\nVersion Control Your Models and Data.\nWhen working on AI projects, it's not just the code that evolves over time, but also your models and even your data can change. Using a version control system like\nGit\nfor your code can help you keep track of changes, collaborate with others and roll back to previous versions when needed.\nMore tips are on our coding blog\nhere\n.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nYou’ll be happy (or disappointed) to hear that very little AI was used this week (besides the picture) in producing this newsletter.\nI did ask ChatGPT to look at its own history and write the tips for the Coding Corner section. I had to mostly use them for inspiration though because, boy, the tips it wrote were very technical.\nIn the news…\nI was interested to see that OpenAI have started\nto push against\nthe idea of people needing to take a course to be a “prompt engineer” and get the most out of their service.\nFour months ago\nwe all thought (me included) this would be the job for the future. Makes sense that OpenAI wants to make the barrier to entry as low as possible.\nGabriella Razzano and Adam Oxford wrote\na piece\nfor The Daily Maverick about a global report by Polis at the London School of Economics. It is an analysis of the current use of AI in journalism. One of the main points is that the use of AI is already heavily uneven when it comes to newsrooms in the Global South and those in the Global North.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI? Our WhatsApp Community is growing\nWe have started a\nWhatsApp Community\nwhich is a selection of groups talking about AI in journalism, podcasting and misinformation in Africa. Join\nhere\n.\nFor our WhatsApp Community we have also started fortnightly sessions where we discuss our thoughts and fears of AI in the media (and how best to share ideas to get ahead).\nWe are offering\npaid mentoring and workshops in AI for newsrooms\n(as well as podcast creation).

Get ready for everything to change."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Produced with www.bing.com/images/create and prompt “two african journalists jumping around and building a podcast episode with AI, photo realistic close up and messy”\nI was in Athens earlier this year. Once I arrived I wasn’t sure entirely why I was there. Ostensibly I was meant to be covering an assassination that had happened two years previously, but quickly I was told that there was a reason this story hadn’t been covered. It’s the only time I have been explicitly told not to cover a story for my safety and actually taken that advice.\nSo, for the next couple of months I walked around the city, hung out with great journalists and ate a crazy amount of feta. But I was also shaken by the encroaching world of AI and was slightly panicked with where media was going. I hunkered down in my Airbnb and started talking to ChatGPT - the world’s new best friend.\nThis was back in April 2023. Since then much has been written and said about AI and what it will mean for every industry, including media. But I had a dream of building an application that could produce a podcast episode from scratch without even needing to record a human voice. I imagined a version of this podcast for Athens, one for Johannesburg, another for London… the day’s news produced by robots and voiced synthetically.\nI spoke to ChatGPT more than anyone else that month. I used Google’s Colab to code (in Python) and had a repetitive, occasionally frustrating and generally exhilarating time.\nWhen this becomes your life… instead of chatting to people about assassinations…\nI managed to get a working script together that would spit out a complete ten minute podcast episode recounting the daily news from Johannesburg, in a discussion format between three trained imaginary voices.\nI had the idea that one of the presenters would always be predicting what would come next in the news - so after the two main hosts recounted the details of a story they would pass it to the third host for his predictions of where the story would go. This was because ChatGPT was stronger at creating imaginary narratives than pumping out facts.\nThe program spoke to Google News, found the top stories of the day and scraped prominent sites for material. ChatGPT couldn’t produce a script from straight wesbite text, so I first had to ask it to convert the news articles into lists of facts and then build a script from the facts. The difficulty was getting each host to then be paired with a different synthetic voice. So, I needed to break the script up into its different lines of dialogue and then send each line to its appropriate synthetic voice emulator. You then pull all the lines back as dozens of small MP3s, stitch them all back together and spit it out as a complete MP3.\nThere were a couple of snags - the cost of synthetic voices (charged per character) was too high. I had envisioned a dystopian factory of a hundred podcast episodes a day - no one even listening to the content before they were published. This was not going to be possible. The other issue was the speed of producing each episode wasn’t as quick as a few clicks and then it was done. You had to send the prompts back to ChatGPT sometimes multiple times to get a coherent script. I had budgeted 2 minutes per episode, but it was closer to ten (which is still impressive for ten minutes of scripted content). The third snag was that the podcast episode was unforgivingly boring… this last one, for someone who\ncreates podcasts\n, was almost a relief. However, the “chatter” among the three hosts was unnervingly authentic and the audio sounded incredibly real. I knew there was huge potential, but it wasn’t a fix all solution.\nI eventually left Athens. I booked a flight to Cape Town (where I went to High School and University) and have settled back here. It’s been five months and since then AI has exploded. I've started\nDevelop AI\nand you can already listen to\na podcast episode developed with the AI tool described in this letter\nusing this newsletter as a basis. We will be releasing this app to the public soon so you can produce your own automated podcast episode.\nWe already have a\nWhatsApp disinformation bot called Uni\n(that I talked about in the\nlast newsletter\n). Try it out and then join our\nWhatsApp Community\nand tell us what you think.\nA version of this article also appeared in\nThe Podcast Sessions\n.\nThis week’s AI tool for journalists to use…\nEleven Labs\nis by far the best AI text to voice service on the market (I used it in my podcast AI tool described above). And you need surprisingly little audio to clone your own voice and use it in your daily life. However, Microsoft and Open AI have swiftly entered the fray by giving ChatGPT\nears and a mouth\nthis week. Listen to samples\nhere\n.\nCoding Corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nThis is a little route one, but\nGoogle’s Colab\nis the place to start when coding.\nThe advantages:\n1) No setup required: You can run your Python code directly in your browser.\n2) Easy sharing: It's integrated with Google Drive so you can share your work with others and access your notebook from any device.\n3) Support for various libraries and frameworks: Colab supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and OpenCV. This makes it perfect for Machine Learning and Data Analysis tasks.\nTo read about Colab’s disadvantages visit our\ncoding blog\n.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nThis week is a moderate win for the humans. AI was used for the photo (created with a free service from\nBing\n) and to summarise the Coding Corner section.\nIn the news…\nSpotify is starting a service that\nwill translate podcast episodes\nand spit them out in the language of your choice BUT keep them in the original voice of the host. I’m a huge fan of\nThe Ringer Podcast Network\nand\nBill Simmons\n(who sold to Spotify in 2020 and consulted on this process). Here are the\nexamples\ndone so far. It is absolutely bananas.\nA questionably\noptimistic report\nwas published this week by Boston Consulting Group and Microsoft (who own a chunk of Open AI) which concluded that AI “can address some of South Africa’s most pressing challenges” and “transform the lives of South African citizens”. Expect more of this type of biased pandering from the people profiting from this tech in the months to come.\nWhat’s new at Develop AI? We are speaking on a panel at Jamfest in Johannesburg\nI am going to\nJamfest\n(an African media and information festival). I was part of the Jamlab accelerator program\nback in 2017\nso I know these folk well (and really respect what they do). I’ll be on a panel talking about best practises of AI in Journalism on the 17th of October at Tshimologong in Braamfontein.\nGet in touch (by replying to this mail) if you would like to chat to us about training workshops or building you a chatbot or AI solution for your newsroom.\nYou can already listen to\na podcast episode developed with the AI tool described in this letter\nusing this newsletter as a basis.\nSee you next week.

Peter Mwangangi, a senior business journalist at BBC Africa, said in a recent article by\nThe Reuters Institute\nthat African journalists should be concerned by who owns the technology, as it largely comes from the West with a certain bias built in. Unfortunately, the recommendation this week is not an African platform, but hopefully we can use it to build our own stuff.\nTensor Flow\nlets you create your own neural network. For example, you can build a program that can be taught to sift through photos of clothes and learn which pictures are what (the computer will understand if it is looking at a picture of a shoe or a pair of pants). I played around with their test versions in Colab (\nincluding a speech recognition model\n) and it slowly started to make sense. You can imagine that creating and training your own neural network could have a huge number of applications for media.\nFor African media people the value is going to be in building the models on the continent, keeping them open source and controlling what we feed into them.\nAfrica’s spots in the The Time Magazine AI 100\nIt is hard to claim that Time magazine is relevant anymore. It feels crushed into the CNN, Time Warner bubble of late 90s monoculture. But, like all flailing media companies, they can still create lists…\nSo, according to\nTime\n, eleven Africans have been named among the 100 most influential people in the world of AI for 2023. I will say that this significant percentage is a good reflection of Africa's burgeoning AI ecosystem. Here are a few highlights:\nInioluwa Deborah Raji, a 27-year-old Nigerian-Canadian computer scientist, is at the forefront of AI activism. Her journey began at the Mozilla Foundation, where she delved deep into the ethical considerations of machine learning. Raji's work is pivotal in shaping the moral compass of AI, ensuring that as machines learn, they do so with a conscience.\nNext… South Africa's Pelonomi Moiloa, CEO and co-founder of\nLelapa AI\n, which aims to use AI to improve the quality of life for Africans. Their most shiny product involves focusing on under-represented African languages.\nFrom Kenya, Kate Kallot's startup, Amini, is revolutionising environmental data collection. They use satellite imaging combined with AI to provide granular insights into environmental changes, right down to the square meter.\nArt and technology often seem worlds apart, but Senegal's Linda Dounia bridges this gap. An artist and curator, Dounia delves into the intricate dance between physical and digital realms, using AI as her canvas.\nJames Manyika from Zimbabwe, with a storied career that includes a stint as a tech advisor in the Obama Administration and a role at Google, is shaping the future of AI regulation. His vast experience and insights are invaluable in navigating the complexity of AI governance.\nAnna Makanju, another Nigerian on the list, is leaving an indelible mark on the global AI regulatory landscape. As the vice president of global affairs at OpenAI, her influence is poised to shape AI regulations worldwide.\nJoy Buolamwini from Ghana, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, is a beacon for ethical AI. Her organization uses a blend of research and art to spotlight its societal implications.\nRichard Mathenge, a Kenyan who played a role in refining ChatGPT, is also championing better working conditions for Big Tech workers in Kenya.\nEthiopia's Abeba Birhane, a cognitive scientist, is pushing the boundaries of responsible AI.\nEritrea's Timnit Gebru is challenging the inherent biases in large language models.\nLastly, South Africa's Shakir Mohamed, a research scientist at DeepMind, has been instrumental in the company's journey from a startup to a global AI powerhouse.\nWe will be starting a\nDevelop AI podcas\nt in the coming weeks so be ready to see a bunch of these names on the pod.\nWhat AI was used in creating this newsletter\n?\nI wanted to transparently document my attempts to use AI to produce what you’re reading.\nI had the idea to document Africa’s spots in the Time 100.\nI downloaded a free plugin in ChatGPT called WebPilot. I then asked it to “write 500 words in the style of journalist Paul McNally” and pointed it to a URL of an article on the candidates and I asked it to single out the Africans.\nThis wasn’t entirely successful. ChatGPT is brilliant at summarising huge amounts of text, but it has a distinct voice and a proclivity for cliches and repeating certain phrases. It did not sound like me at all. I rewrote the article, but it did pull out the key information and made everything a lot shorter.\nThere is a real ambition, I think, for journalists and writers to build a personal model that has been taught on all their work and then has their “voice”. We will be exploring how to do this in future letters.\nCoding corner (the gradual process of a journalist learning how to code)\nThis week I discovered AWS (Amazon Web Services) which I always knew was how Bezos made his billions, but hadn’t fully appreciated. When I think of Bezos I usually think of a website where you can order stuff to be delivered to your house.\nFor more info on my adventures with AWS go to\nour coding blo\ng.\nWhat’s new?
