      "content": "# Investors predict AI is coming for labor in 2026\n\nAI is coming for your job. Or at least, that’s what the investors are betting on. I’ve spent a lot of time in newsrooms over the last year, running workshops from Arusha to Johannesburg to Copenhagen. The mood is the same wherever I go. Excitement, yes, but also a gnawing sense of dread. The question always comes up: who actually benefits when AI gets woven into the fabric of our work?\n\n**The investor predictions**\n\nLet’s start with what’s being said out loud. Investors are openly predicting that 2026 will be the year AI stops being a cute productivity tool and starts making actual humans redundant. Jason Mendel (who I’ve never met, but whose predictions are everywhere right now) says it bluntly: “2026 will be the year of agents as software expands from making humans more productive to automating work itself” [[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/)]. That’s not just about replacing the person in the call centre. It’s about automating the knowledge worker—the journalist, the editor, the researcher.\n\nMarell Evans, another investor with a knack for stating the obvious, puts it this way: “We’ll see more human labor get cut and layoffs will continue to aggressively impact the U.S. employment rate” [[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/investors-predict-ai-is-coming-for-labor-in-2026/)]. The tech world loves to talk about “efficiency.” But what that usually means is fewer people getting paid to do the same amount of work.\n\n**The core issue**\n\nI’ve been in enough editorial meetings (both in Africa and Europe) to know that “efficiency” is a loaded word. It’s the excuse for shrinking teams and hiring freezes. But now, with AI, it’s not just the junior roles on the chopping block. Generative AI is getting good enough to write press releases, summarise reports, even draft entire newsletters. You can plug your data into ChatGPT or use something like Ollama to run smaller models right on your laptop. I’ve done it. It works. It’s not perfect, but it’s getting closer every month.\n\nThe real kicker, though, is that AI isn’t just coming for the “boring” parts of the job. It’s starting to nibble at the creative stuff, too. I’ve seen people use AI to create podcast scripts, generate news headlines, even build entire social media calendars. The result? One person can now do the work of three, if they’re smart about how they use these tools.\n\n**Deep analysis: beneath the hype**\n\nThere’s a lot of talk about “reskilling” and “new opportunities.” That’s the official line every time a new round of layoffs hits. But the truth is that the gap between those who can leverage AI and those who can’t is widening fast. In my workshops, I see it every time: some journalists are hungry to experiment. Others are paralysed, worried that every new tool is just another step toward their own obsolescence.\n\nAnd there’s another uncomfortable truth: even if you become an AI “power user,” you’re still playing in someone else’s playground. The models get updated, the APIs change, the rules shift. What was a competitive edge last month becomes table stakes overnight.\n\n**Real examples: names, tools, lessons**\n\nI’ve worked with newsrooms in South Africa where editors are using tools like Cursor to speed up their coding. In Lagos, I met a team using ElevenLabs to turn text into audio news for WhatsApp distribution. None of these are Silicon Valley unicorns. They’re small outfits, running on tight budgets, but they’re moving faster than most of the big legacy media brands.\n\n> **AI lesson**: The best use of AI right now isn’t to replace people, but to let small teams punch above their weight. If you’re in a newsroom, don’t wait for management to hand down an “AI strategy.” Start automating repetitive tasks yourself. Build your own workflows. Share what you learn.\n\n**Africa/Global South perspective**\n\nThis isn’t just a Western problem. In Africa, the stakes are even higher. Most newsrooms don’t have the luxury of cutting staff—they’re already running lean. What I’ve seen in Nairobi and Accra is a scramble to adapt, not a cull. Editors want to know how to use AI to cover more stories, in more languages, with the same handful of freelancers. There’s real opportunity here for African media to leapfrog old workflows, but only if they get access to the right tools and training.\n\nThe danger, though, is that if we don’t invest in local skills, we’ll just end up consuming AI-generated content built and trained elsewhere. That’s a recipe for irrelevance.\n\n**Practical takeaway**\n\nIf you’re worried about your job, don’t wait for the axe to fall. Start learning how these tools actually work. Pick one task you hate (transcribing interviews, building social posts, whatever) and automate it. Share the results. If your newsroom isn’t talking about AI, start the conversation.\n\n> **Key takeaway**: AI isn’t coming for your job. The people who know how to use AI are.\n\n---\n\n## 📋 News Roundup\n\n- [Instagram’s Adam Mosseri says you can’t trust your eyes anymore](https://www.theverge.com/news/852124/adam-mosseri-ai-images-video-instagram) – Instagram’s boss reflects on the end of “real” content as AI-generated images flood the platform.\n- [Wired: AI Labor Is Boring.

We might see stricter regulations and more rigorous testing before AI tools are released to the public. As creators and journalists, staying informed about these changes will be essential for guiding our audiences accurately.\n\n## A List of Terrible AI Health Summaries\n\nThe BuzzFeed investigation highlighted some glaring examples of AI's failings. Imagine being told that aspirin could cure a viral infection or that certain symptoms of a heart attack could be ignored. These aren’t just errors—they’re potentially life-threatening missteps. Such mistakes highlight why human oversight is irreplaceable in contexts where lives are at stake. This isn’t some minor bug; it’s a fundamental flaw that tech companies need to address before pushing AI tools into critical areas like healthcare.\n\nAs we navigate these AI advancements, it’s vital for us to remain critical and cautious. Our role in the media is not just to inform but to ensure the information is accurate and safe. This incident with Google serves as a wake-up call to scrutinize AI tools more thoroughly before integrating them into our work.\n\nFeel free to reply with your thoughts or share this newsletter with colleagues who might benefit from a deeper understanding of AI's role in healthcare. Our WhatsApp community is always open for discussions on how AI can be better integrated into our work without compromising trust and accuracy.\n\nSee you next week.",
